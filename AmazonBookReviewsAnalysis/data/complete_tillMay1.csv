0,"What can be said, that hasn't already been said about the President?Nothing in this book will surprise anyone who has been following the trials and tribulations of the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.  His supporters will cry foul, and say some of it isn't true -- and some of it might not be -- but if even 10% of what is in this book is true, holy crap!Reading this book is like being forced to eat an entire 5 gallon carton of ice cream in one sitting.  It is yummy and you don't want to stop.  And then you do want to stop but you can't, because the book has you roped in.  You should feel good, but in reality you feel awful, because of what you just did to yourself.So tread lightly, dear reader.  You won't want to put the book down, but you won't be better off for reading it, either.  If you don't like it, do something productive -- stop eating the ice cream and get off the couch.  Make America AMERICA again!",January-5-2018,5
1,I got the kindle version this morning. I probably would not have bought this. I will probably see most of this book for free as the media tears into it over the next few weeks. My decision to purchase was based solely on Trump's furious efforts to keep it from coming out. It was well worth 15$ to do my part to keep this at the top of the best-sellers list.,January-5-2018,5
2,"I am not a phony billionaire.  I am a genuine hourly worker who can afford $15 to show Trump that he can't order a book out of publication in America.  Also, I'm a voter.",January-5-2018,5
3,"Dear. Mr. Wolff, please write another, this one much more informative. Pretend itâ€™s fiction, but we will know.",February-11-2018,5
4,"I like the book, and it coincides with Trumpâ€™s twitter timeline. So if you have been following that, then you are in the know.However, and it could be just me....I felt like it was a book about Bannon?That being said, I cannot wait for part II! (Thereâ€™s going to be a part II, right? - LOL)",January-16-2018,5
5,"Expertly written but every 100th word you'll need a dictionary.  It makes for a much longer read and it's disruptive.  Otherwise, great book !!!!",January-23-2018,5
6,"Wolff's expose of the early months in Trump's White House is a fascinating and necessary read for anyone who wants to know why the administration has operated the way it has.  The pattern of reckless lies and lowbrow behavior evident in the Oval Office may be hard to fathom, but Wolff does a good job of explaining the personalities -- and the personality cult -- surrounding Donald J. Trump.  This sheds a lot of light on the current situation in Washington.Filled with detailed descriptions of events from the early months of the administration, ""Fire and Fury"" provides plenty of ""aha"" insights to add context to the news coverage inside the Beltway.  Key to understanding the prevarications and inconsistencies of Trump is knowing that he surrounded himself with warring factions -- Bannon, ""Jarvanka"", Priebus -- whose conflicting interests were either rebuffed or embraced by a President who lacks both the experience and the wherewithal to make effective policy decisions.""Fire and Fury"" may not lift the dark cloud of the Trump administration, but it goes a long way to help people understand why the current President has struggled in the office, while doing so much damage to the country in the process.",February-25-2018,5
7,"I read every word of the kindle version and enjoyed it very much!  Laughed a lot and probably should have cried as it is a story well told. It is hard to say how much is true and how much is made up but it rings true based on what we know about DJT and his cast of characters.  There are clearly factual errors, misspellings, and other faults here, as is can always be found in something rushed to press but I would still heartily recommend it to someone who enjoys this â€œbehind the scenes kind of thingâ€ù. Unlike the author, and many of the commentators here I disagree that Trump Presidency is heading off a cliff or into a wall as many suggest as a result of his disintegrating mental health and the dysfunction of his office. While it may be true that he is a total nut case I donâ€™t think it correlates at all with what can be accomplished while he is in office. In addition, I think that if HRC were president a similar story could have been told- possibly by the same author. The thing that strikes me the most and is almost comical if it wasnâ€™t so sad is the level of greed and malice that politicians can possess. And in a world where they are so concerned with themselves and their own fortunes the plight of the average good American never comes on the radar. As was said in a similar time long ago as people starved in the streets- â€œLet them eat cake!â€ù  This title is currently all the rage but in short order it will be forgotten. Happy reading!!",January-8-2018,5
8,"This book doesn't wander far from what my expectations of this administration is up to. It's utterly gross, and yet, like the proverbial train wreck, you CANNOT look away. I read the entire thing this morning, and I'm going to have to go back and read it again. To be sure that I actually read all the )#&%# I thought I did, and did such #(%&*# actually make it into a work about how the administration is going about its daily business.This is a constitutional crisis. I have read, already, all the attacks on the author. But everything he says shores up my POV about the administration - they were not prepared, they are a bumbling roadside attraction doing anything they can to keep the audience's attention. When whatever the current shill is turns out not to be what they want you to see, they bumble and fall over one another, inflaming hatred of some ""other"" - from the top down - to shift your attention.I have been watching, enjoying, and debating politics since I was ten. I love to see what current administrations are doing, and even if I voted for them, I'll critique. No one's perfect. But this - good grief. I have been ashamed, from time to time, at some of the actions of past presidents. But I am constantly, 150%, 24/7 ashamed of this administration. There is nothing they do that doesn't hurt, lash out, or inflict damage on some part of the American people. Outside of that group the pres wants to be part of, the billionaires, everyone else is merely fodder.And lord help you if you are anyone other than white and male. Because you're nothing.All this book has done is reinforce what I thought I was seeing. While that makes me sad, angry, and worried - it also reinforces that we must be active, and not complacent - we must, as a nation, go vote for people who will support this nation, and the ideals it has survived on. We have to bring back people who are not the sellout pieces of trash that is our current legislative bodies.Most of all, this book is a warning. Our nation is under siege. If you don't see it - it's because you don't want to, or feel that the siege will benefit you in some fashion. It won't. If it does, it's temporary, and you will pay the piper, and it will hurt. This book should show you that. The pres has loyalty and concern for one person - himself. Anyone else is disposable. That includes the nation he supposedly represents.I suggest you read it. And put down the partisanship, and read it with eyes of ""Is this who I want to represent me?"" Even if only half of this is true, we are in a world of hurt. WE deserve better. The pres and all his sycophantic horde deserve to be bounced out on their backsides. Which begins with the 2018 elections.",January-5-2018,5
9,"While there are a fair number of editing errors in this book relating to grammar, dates, and the spelling of names, theyâ€™re irrelevant. The book was likely rushed into print before legal action could block its distribution. With an initial print run of 150,000 copies, and current sales of ten times that number, thereâ€™s little doubt the public found it valuable reading. You can fact check it, as I did, and youâ€™ll find the facts pretty much on target, with the previously noted caveat. The issue is that roughly 40% of the book cannot be fact checked, being comprised of overheard conversations and conjectures on the part of the author. So it goes. In light of demonstrated behavior, most of the undocumented material rings true, and casts a harsh light on the construction of the Trump government and the people who comprise(d) itâ€” some of them very briefly. So, read it like a novel, or read it like non-fictionâ€” then make up your own mind.",January-26-2018,4
10,"Fire and Fury should be widely distributed and widely read. Some of the book is trashy, but that is a reflection of the sleaziness and crudeness of the president and his awful administration. Perhaps some of it isn't true, but since our president has lied at least 2,000 times during his first year, he can't tell you what is false or not. Actually I doubt that Trump has the intellectual capacity or focus to read a 300-page book. Michael Wolff could have used a good copy editor because his sentences are so convoluted and so overpunctuated I had to re-read some paragraphs. Wolff doesn't really like anyone or any group so in that sense, his book is a not hit piece for the Democrats. The question is ""how long can this train wreck continue?""",January-13-2018,5
11,"On point and that Fly-on-the-Wall feeling was there on every page ...I got it on my Kindle that first day it was rushed to market ...And just in time ... I believe we will look back to recognize how serindipitous a situation this turned out to be ... the right guy in the right place ...Michael Wolff is my almost perfect hero of the year ... a truly observant and insightful feeling and admittedly crafty human being ...... and there was enough differentiation between hearsay and direct interviews, and witnessing it himself so that was clear, yet without interrupting a well-told yarn that was probably not even much of a nedd for exagerration ... well this entire true story is one for the books, many books ... this must be in anyone's collection on this subject forever, right on the top ...Although Mika B decided to kick Michael Wolffe off Morning Joe recently ... I think that was a good skirmish she won, he can handle that criticism, and they will heal, lolMchael Wolffe just earned many accolades and, I hope sudden fortune with this absorbing log of the latter campaign, transition and White House event.You will see, as the months march on [)  the truth will come out as indicated ... well done sir  ...Have Discernment always folks ... and Heart ...",February-6-2018,5
12,"I've seen complaints about the author's writing skills, but I found the book to be well-done. What's upsetting is the view we get of our President and White House and cabinet staff. Some say parts of the book aren't accurate, but if only half of the book is on target it's alarming. The corrections I've seen in the press are minor compared to the overall text.",February-7-2018,5
13,Everything this book exposes this disgusting repulsive bully who pretends to be a United States President. The Genius he claims to be has made a mockery out of the American political system and it is exposed by this writer. The fun thing about this book is the names have not been changed to protect the innocent because there simply were none as the writer has shown. Worth the read.,January-31-2018,5
14,"I thoroughly enjoyed Michael Wolff's portrait of a shallow, vain, semi-literate Mr. Trump.",January-26-2018,5
15,"Although much of what I read in this book was what I always suspected, his succinct narrative confirms it all. Wolfe paints a vivid picture of this disastrous administration and the people inhabiting it. Itâ€™s a great read.",January-13-2018,5
16,"I'm sure that the criticisms of Michael Wolff's work are legitimate: that he's journalistically sloppy, plays fast-and-loose with facts, and shapes reality to suit his own biases. In that respect, he sounds very much like the subject of this excellent, top-notch book -- a book which, despite its problems, nevertheless rings absolutely truthful (or, as Stephen Colbert might put it, ""truthy"").",January-13-2018,5
17,"Most of us know while this probably isn't 100% factual, it's more factual than the things that come out of Trump and Huckabee-Sanders' mouths. A fun little read to further enforce 65% of American's perception of his lack of intelligence, empathy, presidential qualifications, integrity, and a professional hairstylist. Purchase this and troll the troll-in-chief!",January-29-2018,5
18,I am sure that this book has been reviewed by people better than I. I will say that it will be in  the future the book quoted as the book that up set the Trump presidency and helped to bring it down.  Besides Trump himself. Even if two thirds of this book is true or false Americans have voted an person into office who has no clue how to govern.,February-17-2018,5
19,"I purchased this book more for amusement, but it has made me feel like a sane person again.  Bravo Michael Wolff. This book reaffirms everything that most grounded people already knew and have observed from the public presence of this administration.  I have spent the past year wondering why know one will call out the obvious behavior of the current President and his staff. Thank goodness Michael Wolff has. There is nothing surprising or shocking about his narrative except for putting the blatantly obvious out there with no concern for ratings or appeasement.  Who cares if quotes are exactly correct or that the correct person said it? The intentions of this chaotic and  self serving White House needs to be transparent to the American people, especially those who havenâ€™t noticed it yet, for all their good intentions.",January-10-2018,5
20,A really fun book with great insights. It sounds also trustworthy to me. A real pageturner.,January-5-2018,5
21,"I bought this book as a Kindle e-book and read it very carefully. My $15 contribution to the First Amendment. Having seen Wolff hit the talk circuits I had to wonder how he had any access to anything as important as the White House. That was trepidation enough until I started reading the book. The book will scare the living daylights out you because whatever you thought the Presidency consisted of, we now know that a rotting corpse could be President if there are sufficient sycophants around to ""take charge"" and advance their own interests. The most interesting aspect of the book are the characterizations of specific individuals: Ivanka ""dumb as a brick,"" Murdoch's characterization of Trump etc.... The book is detail oriented and hammers the point home that NO ONE IS IN CHARGE of the White House and policy making. No one. On the negative side, I had to wonder explicitly where the information comes from. Wolff is slippery on that question. Most of the info is condensed from multiple parties. In other words, it is gossip soup. Apparently, Wolff did tape 'on the record' interviews. It would be interesting to hear some of those first hand reports because, honestly, the book needs more direct citations. After all It is classified as non-fiction. The most interesting take away point is the relationship between the Presidency (any Presidency) and the intelligence community. There is a dance between the President and the FBI, CIA etc.. of which I was totally unaware. This is where Wolff may truly be on to something.",January-10-2018,4
22,"0.oEven more disturbing than I thought it would be. The author is an experienced schmoozer and celebrity writer, which is how and why he had free access to the Trump White House.  His many hours of taped interviews and insights gleaned from being on hand are all here in this book. Front and center in the Three Ring Circus that is the Trump White House.",January-25-2018,5
23,"So he's saying that Bannon and the alt-right, Trumpism movement is going to be kept alive and funded by a collection of billionaires and the 35% who support Bannon's ideology.  I really don't want that future.",January-8-2018,5
24,Absolutely fascinating. I could not put it down. I am glad we still ahve freedom of speech.,January-5-2018,5
25,"I listened to the excellent 12-hour Audible file read by Holter Graham and frankly wished it was longer. It was like a podcast of political horror fiction, a bombardment of multi-layered and gossipy anecdotes that kept me engrossed yet bewildered in wondering just how true any of the book really was (while hoping that is wasn't). Though taken at face value, Fire and Fury is an absolutely terrifying portrayal of unfathomable blundering and sinister plotting and backstabbing that points to inevitably troubling roads ahead for this White House, the nation as a whole, and possibly the world. Critics of the book's the validity have to seriously bear in mind how such a dismissal reflects upon a WH who allowed Wolff seemingly unfettered access to the West Wing for nearly a year. Assuming that even a percentage of the content is false or embellished doesn't change the fact that the WH aided the author in this book's creation. In fact, denying the book's authenticity only further shines a spotlight on the administration's own terrible judgment, in much of the way that Fire and Fury depicts Trump's insipid stupidity and amateurish incompetence. So, read it, listen to it, enjoy it, and try not to freak out.",January-6-2018,5
26,"I have to aver that this is totally bias propaganda from a left leaning journalist Michael Wolff that portrays the Trump administration in an unflattering portrayal to say the least.  Even having said this even if 25% of what is said or even for that 1% true then God help us!!!  This guy Trump is a shoot by the hip action guy who reacts first and then thinks next of the consequences.  Its not so bad when it comes to pushing legislation and domestic policy as it gets stuff done and is a refreshing brand of politics from the self serving swamp establishment status quo.  But when it comes to foreign policy it is actually a detrimental burden and could start a world war with Trump's impetuousness unchecked.The book goes into fastidious detail on the comings and goings of Trump's first year in office.  Definite must read to learn about the soap opera of Bannon, Jarvanka, McMaster, Preibus and Kelly.  I swear an episode of Dynasty couldn't be more interesting than the inside scoop of the soap opera that Wolf has written.  It has gotten me interested in politics as before I had little interest.  That's one thing you have to give to Trump:  Like or Hate him he has made DC politics EXCITING and INTERESTING again!  The likes we probably have not ever seen EVER!  Maybe the JFK era but JFK wasn't a loose cannon and didn't have twitter access.This book is a good buy for the price $19.99.  Like or Hate Trump, Democrat or Republican you have to read this book to get the dirt on Trump!  The biggest dirt I took from this book is that Donald Trump actually didn't want to win the 2016 election for president and that it was merely a way to gain publicity and to facilitate his creation of a new TV network on cable called the Trump Network.  No wonder Trump's administration was so slovenly unprepared in its first months of his term.  Then there was the salacious tidbit of the shameless Nikki Haley having an affair with the Donald.  The last piece of scuttlebutt I got from the book is that Steven Bannon is planning to run for President in 2020.  What a different world America would be after 2020 if Bannon wins.  Is Trump only the first of a revolution of right wing politicians coming in the future to win positions of power or just a joke to laugh about for four years?  Only time will tell.  Only wish there was information and gossip on Melania about her personality and how she feels about Trump's affairs, Jarvanka and her marriage overall.  Nothing in the book mentions anything about her except a passing reference.  I think if your going to write a Trump book then you have to at least put some information in there on what his wife is like and how she thinks and acts.  In conclusion, there is a reason this book is a best seller and deserves to be (assuming even if 10% of the insinuations and dirt inside are true).  Read this book to get the inside scoop on the blights, conflicts and drama of the Trump administration.",March-30-2018,4
27,Thank you Michael Wolff for documenting what many Americans have thought must be going on in the White House.  I felt like I was listening in on all those conversations.  Outstanding work.,January-11-2018,5
28,This book was very will written. So many of the things Mr.Wolf wrote about have come true. I try to read everything I can about the people that run our Country. No mater which party is running the country. If you want to learn more about the people that are in control I would suggest it to be read.I was very happy that i purchased the book.,February-13-2018,5
29,"I'm still in the process of listening to this VERY informative material, but so far an exciting  ""eye-opening bunch  of news!",January-13-2018,4
30,"If the review format allowed, I would put that OMG in 200-point font. The book describes a farce, not even a Greek tragedy that would require some gravitas, that is spoiled by the real consequences of the actors. A farce that is a nuclear-level Holocaust. And we get to live it, holding our collective breaths, in fear and anxiety.My earnest wish is for the author to write a sequel. Wouldnâ€™t that be grand? Consider a smiley-face here.Read this book.",February-8-2018,5
31,"I hardly think this book needs more publicity, since it took the nation by storm as soon as it came out, but I'll give my two cents. I waited like so many others while it was backordered and finally read it in a couple of  sittings as soon as I got it.What a fun read! I laughed my way through much of it, as Wolff relates anecdote after anecdote illustrating the utter incompetence of the first few months of the Trump regime. He's a witty and funny writer, so the pages go by fast. I took some comfort in the fact that while our nation was under siege by a fascist wannabe dictator and his racist bigoted staff and criminal family, they really had no clue what they were doing. The petty infighting and rampant disfunction of Trump's staff was alarming to hear about, but thank goodness none of them were smart enough to do really serious damage--at least not then.Wolff certainly burned all his bridges in getting people to rat on each other like this, and for that I say thank you! While other journalists were soft-pedaling Trump and normalizing his insane stunts and incoherent ramblings to preserve their precious access to the touchy baby man tyrant, Wolff was happily torching his sources, knowing this mission would be his last with this bunch.Some have denied saying things he attributed to them--like Anna Wintour, for instance. I'm willing to concede that Woolf is more interested in gossip than in Pulitzer Prize-level reporting, so I'll give Wintour and some others the benefit of the doubt. But Trump's racist/bigoted/sexist henchmen and family? Never. I believe every word Wolff reports about them.The only part of the book that slowed down for me was toward the end on a couple pages when I got the feeling Wolff's editor must have been standing over him with a ruler, ready to rap his knuckles unless he formed a few serious conclusions about how bad this all was for us--the crazy mayhem he was so gleefully describing on all the other 300 or so pages.Yes, there are some typos and errors that should have been caught through more careful proofreading--and that's why I'm penalizing Wolff a star and giving this 4 out of 5. But they don't detract from the overall gist of the book and they don't make me distrust the piles of consistent evidence Wolff supplies about Trump's White House.If you don't want to buy the book because you think you've heard all the good parts on talk shows and in Wolff's interviews--think again. Every page has something juicy and only by reading it will you be able to enjoy the tone and the style--which is a big reason I like it and recommend it. No, Mueller will probably not be referencing this in his indictments against Trump and his cronies, but as priceless background info on the Trump Reich, and for comic relief, this book can't be beat.edit: typos!",April-24-2018,4
32,"If only ten percent of this is true America is in peril for sure.  I only wish the authors writing style was a little less choppy.  There are lots of convoluted, complicated sentences that seem too wordy to get the point across.  That being said, if one can stick with it, the point does come across.  Perhaps if the writer would have tossed the thesaurus out and just spoke more plainly, it would have a greater impact.  That's why I only gave four stars; the bravery of it deserves five stars, and I am glad somebody finally said all that.",January-16-2018,4
33,"Michael Wolff's ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House"" promises from the beginning to offer a fly-on-the-wall view of the way things work (or don't) inside the Trump Administration. Early in his account, Wolff describes the campaign as resembling Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"" (pgs. 15-16) and this characterization, coupled with the political infighting of ""Game of Thrones"", dominates the feel of the book from then on. Steve Bannon emerges as the ""protagonist"" (if there is one) as much of the story revolves around his work to brand Trump's particular style of politics and turn it into a movement or his work to assert himself as the power-behind-the-power in the White House. The end result is a narrative that leaves one feeling somewhat dirty or complicit for this inside look.While Wolff's account feels true, and he had libel lawyers read the manuscript to make sure it was safe to publish, I would have liked to see the extensive notes section one expects in a book from a journalist. He only mentions early on that he either witnessed many of these events or was told them by people who are given away in his account. Some kind of documentation would have been preferable, even if it meant a lot of interviews not for attribution listed at the end. Also, for anyone who's been following the news these last few months, most of this information is already out there. Indeed, Wolff regularly quotes from CNN or New York Times headlines. Further, the news coverage of this book was so extensive that most people who read it will find exactly what they expect based on that coverage.If you are interested in politics or current events, give it a read, but save yourself the money and get it from the library.",April-19-2018,3
34,"Even though basically nothing should be shocking at this point, I found myself gasping internally pretty frequently. Honestly, if the things depicted in this book was made into a movie, youâ€™d be rolling your eyes at how â€œunbelievableâ€ù it was. Sadly, itâ€™s all too believable based on, well, basically everything trump says during his televised speeches.The book definitely has an agenda. Itâ€™s not by any means trying to be neutral & â€œstate the facts,â€ù but Iâ€™m ok with that because itâ€™s a good hate read. I liked how the author gives the sources as heâ€™s able or puts statements in quotes vs saying when somethingâ€™s parapharsed, heresay, etc.For someone whoâ€™s interested in current events, but gets much of my news from John Oliver (rip the old daily show), this was an easy, enjoyable (is it wrong if itâ€™s enjoyable? TBD) read. Nice to be able to see how the different stories fit together and to learn whoâ€™s who in trumpâ€™s circle (or rather, who was who).Looking forward to the sequel after impeachment",March-12-2018,4
35,"If this book is even partially true, we are in deep trouble.  I voted for Trump in hopes he would change the way Washington works.  I expected a serious, mature, successful CEO business approach to challenge the status quo.  This book reveals not only how Trump leadership is non existent, but how the whole political process is in shambles.  I'm ashamed of what our government has become.",January-21-2018,4
36,Surprisingingly good read. Of course there's plenty of gossip here but it comes close to giving some reasonable explanations for the apparently inexplicable.The author also has a sense of humor. Unless you're a bootlicking supporter of 45 you will find it worthwhile to read.,February-5-2018,5
37,"Well-written, insightful, and actually quite balanced despite its somewhat lofty and (delightfully) snarky air. Wolff writes about very unpleasant personalities behaving in unpleasant ways, and he does so unflinchingly. Yet he doesn't do so from some personal attack agenda, and he doesn't let anyone off the hook. Since I have read the book, I have been less bewildered, though no less dismayed, by the behavior coming out of the White House and, to some degree, Congress: Fire and Fury does a lot to create context for those of us who are puzzled by the apparent senselessness of this administration's behavior. Four stars rather than five only because (1) there were some instances where I would have very much liked to have known how Wolff got the info (i.e., was he in the room when a particular conversation was taking place?), and there are several instances of misspellings and/or typos -- probably because Trump's tantrum over the book and his public attempt to suppress it led to it being rushed to its release by the publisher.",January-29-2018,4
38,"I couldn't out this book down.  Trump camp has tried to spin this as untrue.  The irony is that, in Trump fashion, Wolff scammed his way into the White House.  After spending months there observing, he offers the point of view only some with long term access can provide.  It largely confirms what anyone following politics has already surmised.",January-21-2018,5

41,"I was never one for horror movies or stories.  All the unlikely storylines, the exaggarated acting, the piercing screams and excessive fake blood.  Fire & Fury proves to be the one exception...it's the horror story that rings all too true, right down to the monsterous character responsible for it all.  Having been on the planet earth over the last year, it's certainly not difficult to believe any of the story; though, it proves to be far worse than what I'd previously imagined.  The damage that one man has been able to do to our great nation is truly horrific... and the lack of interest in putting and end to that damage from the remaining political establishment is criminal in itself.  Hopefully, it proves to be a short story.  Too, lets hope we learn some (hard) lessons from all this and institute ways to prevent one person from causing such carnage in the future.The story was well written and captured the reader's attention from beginning to end.  The narrator did a good job delivering the story without distracting from the author's words.  Well done to the author, narrator and all those involved in bringing us this unfortunate reality story.",January-10-2018,5
42,"This book is not the typical right verses left story. In fact, the left is mentioned only in passing. This is about the chaos and infighting among the people in the West wing with Trump in charge.  It describes what John McCain, Mitt Romney, the entire Bush family, and multiple other people were concerned about.  Very thought provoking...",February-12-2018,5
43,"Forget his detractors. Wolff is telling an important story here, and there have been exactly zero credible denials of the key material facts presented herein. Yes, there is opinion and speculation here, particularly when Wolff tries to infer affect and intention from outward behavior. But there's no attempt to package opinion as fact, and it's not difficult to separate the subjective from the objective.  One can argue how much you'll know about the Trump White House, in the sense of quantifiable data, after reading this astonishing book. But what is irrefutable is how much you'll *understand* this administration and its tragic, even fatal flaws.  This is the proverbial ""fly on the wall"" chronicle, and is a must-read for anyone that wants to grasp the breadth of dysfunction and degeneracy that attend this Presidency.",February-21-2018,5
44,"What a great read! First and foremost, Wolff offers us an amazing behind-the-scenes perspective into the disarray in the White House.  Most of us will never get this kind of fly-on-the-wall access. Everyone portrayed seems much more human than they do on TV. That's both reassuring and scary.The main reason I couldn't put this book down was the amazing pace of cataclysmic events.  Were this a work of fiction, it would seem so implausible that it wouldn't hold my interest.  But since the last 12 months of news corroborates so much of what's in here, it becomes a thriller. (It also makes the news more interesting, like 'bonus material'.)  I read the entire book cover-to-cover in maybe three days.",January-15-2018,5
45,Great book. It tells us what we already knew.  The fact a president called for this book to be banned made it more interesting.,January-8-2018,5
46,"What a Wild ride of a book. I am still shaking my head to see this all in print. This  book is one of those instances where truth IS stranger than fiction. Events over the past year have moved so quickly that I feel that I am on a treadmill without a control. Whenever I feel I might be in a comfort zone the treadmill moves up a couple of notches.This book has let me see what has happened to  our country since the election of Trump & it isn't a pretty sight.I feel like a fly on the wall overhearing the conversations , visualizing the backstabbing, and watching the exits of so many staff members.. This is a must read for any followers of Shakespeare & it doesn't look as though it will end well for most of the cast of characters .What a gossipy, fun book to read. I bought the Kindle edition so that I could read it right away.",January-7-2018,5
47,"This book takes an emotionally strong person to finish without being overcome with anxiety and anger. It's clear that even those closest to Trump think he's unfit for office, yet go a long with it to claim their own power. It's clear to me that America is in the middle of a serious crisis unlike any we've faced before.A blue wave can't come soon enough.",January-26-2018,5
48,"When I read this book I feel as if I am sticking it to the man...or in this case Trump. I cannot speak for the books authenticity, but it does explain a lot of what many people suspected about Trump and his Administration. If only Trump would just resign and stop torturing his voters and the rest of America.",February-15-2018,5
49,"Thankfully I'm not a US citizen. If I was, this book would make my cry. Trump never expected or wanted to be US President by all accounts and it started out as a grandiose ego trip that went badly astray when he won.  Well worth the read, if only to confirm one's thoughts on the partisan politics running the USA today.",January-27-2018,5
50,Bought this book if for nothing else to piss Trump off.  Will be best $15 spent.  Hope to see this on the best sellers list so I'm doing my part.  And yes I can't wait to read it.  He has spent the last year pissing me off so turn about is fair play!,January-5-2018,5
51,"I personally do not believe there is one bit of "" Fake News"" in FIRE and FURY. The spin doctors can try to spin it, but anyone with eyes and ears can corroborate the events detailed in the book. There were times when I actually had to laugh out loud at this sad and tragic tale. How far the U.S. has fallen with the election of Donald J. Trump. Excellent read!",January-23-2018,5
52,"I really enjoyed this book.  It felt as if it organized the craziness of the past year into a cohesive timeline.  There were many things I forgot about because this past year has been one disaster after another.  It was interesting to read about the infighting occurring among the various players of the executive staff.  The book basically covers the events that we had all heard about, but knowing who was doing what, or why they were doing it provided an interesting background.  I was never bored reading this, and more than once found myself shaking my head saying, ""You can't make this s*@t up.""  You'll find yourself bouncing between disbelief, humor, anger, sadness, and incredulity while reading this book.",February-13-2018,5
53,"Like many other reviewers, I really only purchased this book in protest. I normally donâ€™t read â€œcelebrityâ€ù gossip, and I have a feeling thatâ€™s what much of this book is. However, if even 10% of the information is accurate, what an even more frightening situation we are in. We the People must continue to fight back against a president who strives to dictate what we read and how we think.",January-6-2018,5
54,"Reading the background info on Trump actions over the last year plus, clarifies the dysfunction based upon the greed for power of all these soulless individuals. The only character not present was Satan!",January-15-2018,5
55,"Fire and Fury is way beyond a story about political intrigue. It is a frightening tale. It is a very dark comedy, darker still because every word is most likely true..At some points I thought I was reading "" Game of Thrones"". This book scares me. I thought at some times, "" this is like the horror version of the television show ""The Office"".Michael Wolff.... thank you, your the best!",January-22-2018,5
56,"Since Trump became president, nothing is his presidency has made much sense to me. His â€œmake America great againâ€ù theme was not being followed. In fact, it seemed like it was just the opposite - dismantling America, at home and abroad. This book, challenged as it has been by Fox, put everything into a rather clear perspective and is consistent with facts that are indisputable.  This book frightens me, yet gives me hope that good people will eventually jump ship, sooner or later.",January-16-2018,5
57,"With a lot of the reviews of the bad editing of the Kindle edition I decided to order & endure the extended wait for the hardcover edition.  I'm hoping that edition will contain satisfactory editing which will make the read easier.On that note though, I did peruse the Kindle edition belonging to a relative.  I didn't read much at all, just enough to give me a taste, as I didn't want to spoil the impact for me.  But I wasn't all that surprised by the content I did read as it simply reinforces what we have been experiencing over the last year being reported by mainstream news outlets & 45th's incessant tweets.I am a registered Democrat, though do not always stick to the party line.  It is my opinion that the BEST person for a job should have it even if they aren't of my political affiliation.  Go ahead other Dems, call me a traitor, but I truly am not.  About 95% of the time I do vote my party since that is where I almost always find a candidate who suits what I feel are the needs of this great nation.  That is just one of the great things of the USA...we have the power to make our own choices!But I am a diehard Trump critic.  So Trump supporters, there's your bullseye to attack me.  I have never been a ""fan"" long before he even thought of running for POTUS.  Nothing in the world prepared me for him actually winning the election.  Needless to say, my opinion of his policies, temperament, business ethic, supervisory style, personality & lifestyle have only gotten worse.But so far, through all his antics, America still supports our constitution & the bill of rights as demonstrated by not only the writing of this tome but by the failed attempt by the administration to stop its publication; just one of this administration's attempt to worm its way around our founding father's principles for this country.  Any publication he tries to stop & hates so very much must be full of so many things he wishes not to go public.  That should both scare us & empower us to affect change.",January-21-2018,5
58,"Engaging book. I bought it simply because 45 didn't want anyone to buy it. Yes, pretty damning. And we're still here.Thanks, Michael Wolff.Stay informed, America.",January-27-2018,5
59,"Fire and Fury didn't tell me much I didn't already know (or suspect) about Donny T. and his minions, but it was still an entertaining read. My one complaint would be that it's too Bannon-heavy. Pretty much every chapter has Sloppy Steve's footprint on it. I was fascinated by the way the staff has to work around Donny to try and get anything done and how pretty much everyone is looking for a way to push his or her own agenda. There's no sense of teamwork here. Everyone is in it for him/herself.",January-20-2018,4
60,Thoroughly disturbing portrayal of the shell of a man being led by opposing forces trying to lead our country.,January-5-2018,5
61,"I could not find any ""Fake News"" or ""Alternative Facts"" in Michael Wolff's book. It was definitely worth the price and I had a very difficult time putting it down. When I heard that Donald J. Trump had won the election, the hair on my arms stood straight up--and not from any amount of excitement, to say the least. My gut instinct was that ""our country was now in ""Big Trouble"", and that instinct was ""Spot On"", as usual for me. Trump is 100% pure NARCISSIST. They should have his picture in the dictionary next to the word. He covers up his lies with more lies, then gets confused about which lie he used previously. He calls himself a ""Christian"", but does not practice even the simplest forms of Christian behavior. He treats his wife like a second-class citizen and shows her no respect at all. If he is doing those things to Melania in public, I have to wonder what a hell her private life with this man must be like. I could go on an on, but will leave it a this: I dream of the day when America won't have to hear or see the name of ""Donald J. Trump"" ever again. I hope he will go down in a whirlpool of much-deserved shame and end up with nothing. Much the same as Kwame Kilpatrick did, as mayor of Detroit.",May-5-2018,5
62,"""Fire and Fury"" confirmed much of what I have suspected about the Trump administration from various media outlets, as well as from other informational texts.  Wolff's narrative explains what happened ""before"" and ""after"" Trump's Twitter storms and his statements to the press.  I had no difficulty believing what I was reading because it tracked so clearly with everything I've seen since Trump announced that he was running.  The attributed quotations and the list of sources named in the Acknowledgements adds to Wolff's credibility. Trump's response to the book further lends credibility to Wolff.  Wolff's book is like a voice-over of a Trump montage of the past two years.",January-10-2018,5
63,"One must read this book regardless of whether they believe it to be true or not.I ordered this book knowing full well that it could only confirm what I think is already true. I thus read it as detached as possible, refusing to lend the credence of fact to it. It is impossible, no matter how much it wasn't, to at this time confirm anything written in this book. It may be entirely factual. It may be a disorganized tapestry of erroneous observations and inferences that only somewhat resembles reality. Neither matters.This administration has proven that they are capable of lying about things that are factually provable, and then minutes after making a statement, after being confronted with evidence, deny the statement took place. They have bred an environment where everything is believable, because nothing is believable. It has created an environment where any story, told with enough certainty and skill, by anyone with remotely decent credentials, will be believed.Do not read this book and go to your friends and social media and say, ""See!? Everything I think is true has been confirmed!"" Likewise do not read it and exclaim, ""This is all nonsense! How could anyone believe this!?"" Instead read this book and realize that for one of the first times, this is a truly neutral piece of work. It may be entirely partisan and grotesquely incorrect. It may be completely faithful to reality and a recitation of pure fact. It is likely neither, and it is even more likely that the public will never know which it is.",February-15-2018,4
64,"Michael Wolff is a great story-teller, evoking strong images of people of Trump & Co. entangled in jealousy, intrigue, deception, incompetence, hubris, and ignorance.  If the events had taken place in some distant, but familiar country, the narrative would be engrossing and even addictive to read as something in the tradition of Greek tragedy.  The events are known from news reports, but Wolff provides color and immediacy.  If anything, the breathtaking degree of detail is too great to be journalism, because the author could not have been a first-hand observer of many of the events.  He does say that he had many -- anonymous -- interviews with people of the White House.  Rather, the engaging narrative is more like ""historical fiction"", in which real events are described with embellishments to provide verisimilitude.  Viewed in this way, the book is an engaging ""page-turner.""However, the events that Wolff describes are real and take place in this country, and there are intense political connections.  That fact changes everything.  Depending upon the reader's political preference, this book may range from being a very engaging read to a despicable scandal sheet.  The strongly anti-Trump readers will be having Raves, and the strongly pro-Trump readers will be in denial.  There is room for readers between these two extremes to read, learn, and to reflect on the real events, apart from the embellishments.I don't know Wolff's credentials as a journalist, but based on this book, he is a very good story-teller.  He begins with the assertion that Trump & Co. had no expectation that he would win, and as a consequence, they were totally unprepared for that event.  His narrative provides a clean timeline of major events that have been well documented by others.  There were no huge surprises compared to existing public accounts of the atmosphere of the Trump World, and many of the accounts ring true with what has been said elsewhere.  However, the amount of detail offered is new and breathtaking.  It reads much like contemporary notes taken by a firsthand witness to the events.  The author essentially states that that is not the case; rather he has assembled a narrative from information he received from numerous people within Trump & Co., whose closeness to the actual events described is not -- cannot -- be revealed.  However, it is an easy conclusion that Steve Bannon was a major source.One of the most important events described is the leading up to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort with Russians in June 2016 at Trump Tower, and the fallout when knowledge of the meeting becomes public a year later.  There is panic among the principals while traveling to and from Germany for the G20 Summit when the NY Times article is about to be filed.  Wolff's narrative is exceptionally vivid in describing the mixture of panic, confusion, infighting, blame-laying, desperation, and incompetence of those involved in generating a response to the article.One place where Wolff falls down is the Epilogue.  It reads like an afterthought.  The book should have simply ended with Bannon's departure and avoided the temptation of prognostication.  Not only is the tone different from the rest of the book, but some of it simply did not work out ""as planned.""There is an extreme irony: The satirical article titled ""We Have a Serious Problem"" by Douglas McGrath in the New Yorker of 18 January 2016 on the developing Trump candidacy could well be used as the prologue of this book.  It begins with Trump deciding to run as a publicity stunt, and ends with him saying, ""We have a serious problem ... I might win.""  At the time it was written, it was a harsh parody.  Now, the meshing of the satire before and the reality now is unsettling.  Harvey Weinstein is even mentioned in the first paragraph, albeit in a different context from that of today!Think of this book as a good movie about real historical events.  Whether or not the movie is correct in details, its vivid images form the lasting memory of the events.  It will become a defining moment in the Trump saga, and it is a must-read for both opponents and proponents of Donald J. Trump as President of the United States.",January-7-2018,5

70,"I recommend this book as a way of getting a feel for being inside the White House for the first two hundred days of Trumpâ€™s administration. Just the fact that he was there, given access, and was unsupervised speaks volumes to the chaos in the White House. Bannon seems to be his most valuable and credible informant.  Worth reading!",January-29-2018,5
71,"This book is about the thoughts and actions of those working in the White House under the current president. Therefore, in my opinion, interviews with the president himself were unnecessary.

72,"A lot of assumptions based on the subjects' intent and unspoken inner dialogue, but an entertaining read, and watching the 24-hour news cycle, it was not hard to draw those conclusions along with the author.

I follow politics pretty closely, and not only did all of this ring totally true, but it really gave me an increased depth of understanding about all the different players/factions within the White House. It's added to my enjoyment watching the (continuing) madness that has occurred this week - Hope Hicks is out; Kushner's security has been downgraded; McMaster looks to be leaving shortly, etc. Get yourself a copy and enjoy the ride...but don't wait too long or you may be reading it as a historical document (i.e., the cast of characters may all be gone)!",March-2-2018,5
75,"I don't generally read contemporary political books- I'm much more likely to read histories/biographies pre-1960's. I prefer to get most of my political information from a wide variety of readable news sources. Like any contemporary account, this book must be viewed with a critical eye and in the context of it's times. I have little doubt that much of what was presented here was said- but it's impossible to say how much is true. Still it's a valuable resource in attempting to understand the machinations of our current government and to a degree how we got here in the first place. The author does a good job of setting up and maintaining a good, approachable pace. I'd recommend this book to anyone with curiosity and a critical mind.",January-8-2018,5

If you really want to understand what is going on now in the White House, this will give you the background about the various factions, etc.  I found myself thinking again and again:  ""Oh, so THAT'S why that (name an event) happened."" I had not realized how much Ivanka and Jared Kushner's ""advice"" has impacted things -- in particular, hirings and firings.  In another universe they could have been a force for good.  The nepotism rule should absolutely be exercised in the White House.  Bannon is revealed as the malevolent and evil creature I always suspected him to be times 100.  Trump -- you really have to wonder if he is pre-Alzheimer's, as well as afflicted with the various -isms of mental illnesses that are widely discussed in the media. I doubt there has ever been anyone so ill-prepared, intellectually deficient, and emotionally weak to hold the job of US President. Those of us who were in shock for a month after the election knew in our hearts this was the case. Certainly the maniacal tweets are evidence, as well.  But this book's many stories are just more evidence.",April-14-2018,5
82,"There are a couple of things to note in reference to this review.  First, I seldom, if ever, read books in this particular genre, i.e. political stuff.  Second, I am an independent as to politics.  I vote for the person and not the party and over the past six decades plus of voting my record has been about 50/50 as to which party candidate I voted for.  I pretty much hold both parties in contempt and go for the candidate rather than the party.That being said...when I found that this work had been put on the â€œTrumpster Index Expurgatorius....well I had to purchase it and read it despite my distaste for this sort of work.  I wondered why this man(?) so badly wanted to stop this books publication...what did he want to hide?I, like many others here take works such as this with a grain of salt.  But I will tell you that if even a small fraction of the information presented here is true (and I have no doubt it is) then it makes my blood run cold.  Now I am not one of those who feel that the circus which is Trump will bring down our nation.  Hey, we survived bad apples before such as Harding, Andrew Johnson, Pierce, Fillmore, Garfield, et al and of course we will NOT be able to fully assess Trumps impact upon our nation for at least fifty or seventy five years from now, but even leaving out the information in this book it is becoming pretty obvious where Trumps place in history will land.The book is written in a chatty way (something I dislike) but the information I found pretty well covered most of the events as we have all seen played out over the past year or so.  I had no reason to doubt much of the information presented here.I do feel that the author probably placed too much of his own â€œspinâ€ù on some of the facts but most readers will be able to spot this quite quickly and make up their own mind.I suspect that over the next decade or so we will see a plethora of books addressing this administration and this clown written by insiders and political pundits. This is good because as I write this review so much more has been discovered and by all signs there will be much more to come.  I am glad I forked out the few dollars as I was at least (in a goulash way) entertained as I read it and I must admit rather frightened.Those who are Trumpsters will, if they even read the book, will not be pleased.  For the other 65 percent plus of the voter population...well, they probably will get a kick out of it.",March-21-2018,5

The endless players on the stage endure the abusive mind of 45. They arrive, attempt to help, then spin off as the tragedy continues to burn down civilized discourse. Nepotism rules this White House. Chapter 5, Jarvanka, was my fav. How was Michael Wolff able to capture so many delightful insights regarding the internal strife of this current failing administration? Well done Sir! Trump's inability to lead, motivate, inspire is prevalent all thru this wonderful book. The book is a classic study of people and their behavior in groups. Trump loves to abuse all comers, even his children, even Hope Hicks. The book helped me understand more about the inner workings of Trump's illnesses. Trump's handlers are unable to manage his tantrums, his lack of ethos. Reality is not his world. 45's addiction to golfing is far more important than caring for the citizens of the USA in his mind. This book is epic. It should be required reading for all high school students.",February-4-2018,5

It is a really interesting portrait of the inside dynamics of the white house transition period and first year.  It's high drama, which isn't generally my interest.  But, in this case, it seems corroborated from what has been public about the administration.  And, while it is far from reassuring, I'd rather know.",January-11-2018,5

It's not suprising that the least qualified, worst Presidential candidate in history has made an absolute mockery of the Presidency, turning it into a tawdry, tabloid reality TV show. The book helps to shed light on some of the most controversial and unpopular decisions made by this President.

I enjoy politics and debates, but it has become entertainment for us to consume and to ignore policies that are being pushed that may or may not affect us all.  The â€œme politics,â€ù you can hear that every time he speaks, you can hear that when people talk about what they want not what the country needs to grow and survive.  This book reads like a Soap Opera whoâ€™s in and whoâ€™s out, who is winning and who is sad. I donâ€™t know if everything in this book factual but we are living in a fact-free world, but if 80% of what he wrote is accurate then thatâ€™s horrifying.",January-16-2018,4
101,"This is a compelling read that connects  exquisitely the known events with the new insights.  This is a must read!  Certainly, the contents are disquieting,  but we need to wake up and take note of political events and the self serving participants. Highly recommended reading.",January-17-2018,5
102,"Like previous reviews said, I bought this to show that Trump can't keep a book from being published.  I am a retired school teacher, but I too can afford the $15.00.",January-9-2018,4
103,"There is nothing in this book that will surprise anyone who has watched the dumpsterfire that has been the Trump presidency.The book makes it clear that Trump wanted to run for president -- maybe even to win! -- but he really did not want to serve as president, which is one reason why he is doing such a terrible job of it. Folks have been nit-picking and fact-checking this book, line by line, but even it only 80 per cent of it is true, then we have a truly horrendous president. Based on everything I have read and seen from many news sources, including those on the Right, I estimate the book's accuracy at well over 90 per cent.Buy and read this book. But don't expect to be truly surprised.",March-14-2018,5

105,It's probably a measure of how absolutely fascinating this Trump Administration has been that I actually got to the end of this book. This has nothing to do with the quality of the writing and more to do with my trumpian attention span. I really have trouble intently reading a book and it can take me months. I polished this off in a week and I have to say that I enjoyed the read. There have been critics of the factual accuracy of Wolff's interpretation of events but I think that there is a lot of envy among the media for the level of access that Wolff was able to gain and I find his version entirely plausible and consistent. I got my money's worth and I would strongly recommend this book.,January-14-2018,4
106,A must read . Laugh out loud funny. If only it wasn't so scary. Bannon actually seems smart compared to trump. Bannon....,January-11-2018,5

108,"We did this to ourselves.  Enough of us voted for this man to put him in office.  Let's be more careful and intelligent about it next time we vote.  No one should be surprised about what they read in this book. Nonetheless, read this book!!",January-6-2018,5
109,"Everything in this book rings true, and you will discover a great deal about the machinations behind Trump's most ignorant and hateful pronouncements. Well written narrative with  plenty of dark humor. Wolff is of the same school as Hunter Thompson, Tom Wolff and even Norman Mailer, so read the book in that light.",January-13-2018,5
110,"Recommended to anyone concerned about their family, friends and world .  Fire and Fury is a lively, well written (in spite of what Samantha B thinks) fly on the wall report on a disfunctional White House headed by an idiot whose daily outrages distract from the real harm",January-26-2018,5

113,"Have just skimmed the book but already have learned many fascinating and depressing details about the president's family and cohorts, and the author's insights into the circus that is the current presidency. So much great info that only someone who was there so much would know. THANK YOU Michael Wolff for the great reporting and giving us this gift - it was a bit of therapy for the stress and depression many of us have had for the last year and somehow eases the pain a little to understand how and why this all happened. Thank you Michael also for being brave enough to weather the criticisms of so many Republicans and Trump Supporters (why again are they so willing to let him damage the environment, our democracy, our relationships with almost every other country, race relations, women, minorities, immigrants, and the lower and middle class in just one year? Just pure greed? Disgusting)  And thank you to the Publisher for getting the book out in true record time!  Final thought for author: Would love for you to release a few minutes of your tapes someday!!",January-9-2018,5
114,"It's not exactly what I expected, but that's a good thing. I found it well written (I'm not a genius, I had to look up a couple of words' exact meaning, and that's always a plus for me). The book illuminates some of the ways we got into this travesty, and fleshes out the main characters in the White House mess. Now I just wish they could be FLUSHED out as well.See you all on January 20, 2018, in the city nearest you.",January-11-2018,5
115,Interesting account of how we ended up with this embarrassing clown as the president. Worth purchasing.,February-7-2018,5

117,"With extraordinary access to the West Wing, Michael Wolff reveals what happened behind-the-scenes in the first nine months of the most controversial presidency of our time in Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.  Since Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, the countryâ€”and the worldâ€”has witnessed a stormy, outrageous, and absolutely mesmerizing presidential term that reflects the volatility and fierceness of the man elected Commander-in-Chief.  This riveting and explosive account of Trumpâ€™s administration provides a wealth of new details about the chaos in the Oval Office, including:  â€” What President Trumpâ€™s staff really thinks of him  â€” What inspired Trump to claim he was wire-tapped by President Obama  â€” Why FBI director James Comey was really fired  â€” Why chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trumpâ€™s son-in-law Jared Kushner couldnâ€™t be in the same room  â€” Who is really directing the Trump administrationâ€™s strategy in the wake of Bannonâ€™s firing  â€” What the secret to communicating with Trump is  â€” What the Trump administration has in common with the movie The Producers  Never before in history has a presidency so divided the American people. Brilliantly reported and astoundingly fresh, Fire and Fury shows us how and why Donald Trump has become the king of discord and disunion.My Thoughts: Within the pages ofÂ Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, the reader will find more than enough information to reinforce his or her view of the current administration.To learn that the Trump camp had other plans besides winning, like creating their own media empire, seems totally plausible. But now that Trump is in, he has doubled down and cemented his position, longing for the attention and loyalty he believes that he deserves.If he doesnâ€™t like something, he tweets a rant; in fact, Twitter ranting is his go-to reaction to what he calls â€œfake newsâ€ù or a â€œwitch hunt.â€ùAround him, in the West Wing, chaos reigns. The rivalry between staff members reminds me of a huge dysfunctional family, and the enmity grows with each passing day. As the ongoing investigation into collusion and obstruction of justice continues, we watch daily for new informationâ€_and new rants from the Ranter in Chief.Reading this book will not be an uplifting experience. But if we arm ourselves with knowledge of what is happening in Washington, we might be able to take action. I am familiar with protests, having been young during the Vietnam War. Having watched Nixon be investigated, with the threat of impeachment hovering, I can live through the experience again. Hopefully, sooner rather than later. A 5 star read.",January-27-2018,5
118,"A sad recounting of our executive branch.  Most amazing is that 35% of Americans still support this non-leader.  It's not just Trumps right wing politics, which he has effectively used to co- op the conservatives to support him, its that this part of America is willing to support such incompetence so their ""side"" wins.As we pass the first year in office , I'd like to see all Americans say ""America First"", not the ""Trump and Trump Family"" first.  Support America, not one who doesn't have the understanding of its greatness and singularity",February-11-2018,4

120,"I knew I had to buy this when Donald pitched a fit to pull it from the shelves. Fascinating, depressing and funny at the same time. If it was fictional, it would be even funnier. And yet, this is our dad reality, not some crazy comedy.I keep hearing how the one good thing about having this loser in the White House is the test on the checks & balances of our government, but LORDY, I would have never imagined until now that our county could fall to such a low level, that so many who could help stop it would turn a blind eye based on politics over ethics. It would be nice if this account opens even more eyes and isnâ€™t dismissed as more background noise that fades away. Wake up America, please letâ€™s get this idiot out.",January-7-2018,5
121,Unbelievable! A fun read...if it weren't for the fact that it's probably true. You have to wonder how anything gets accomplished in this WH.,February-6-2018,5
122,"This is an audio version of the book and I really like the author's perspective on the Trump Whitehouse. The author has expressed his astonishment at being 'like a fly on the wall' there. Also the author did a good job reading the book. I am convinced that the value of audio in book reads is injected by the reader (preferably the author) with his tone, inflection, humor, etc. expressed as only the author can. Another virtue of audio is that I can 'read' this book while at the gym working out or just walking. Very nice! This book did not disappoint! If I want to 'study' the book I will buy the digital version where searching is king.",January-26-2018,5
123,"Extremely helpful in trying to comprehend the incomprehensible.  Woolf is a â€œfly on the wallâ€ù whose insights are invaluable to understanding (and I use that word loosely) the Trump administration.  Given how ridiculously ignorant the American public must be to elect such an obviously unqualified and incompetent person to be President, it makes one wonder if a basic civics and American history test should be administered every 4 years to prospective voters to successfully pass before being allowed near a voting booth.  This was the easiest election decision in history.  And yet apparently American citizens take their democracy so much for granted (over half CHOSE not to go near a voting booth assuming they were even aware that a Presidential election was happening).  An informed and educated citizenry is the only way to inoculate the country from morons, charlatans, and foreigners (Russians).  I truly feel sorry and embarrassed - the fragility of our democracy, on which the world itself depends, is on display for everyone to see.Maybe the FBI should start looking into Rupert Murdochâ€™s connections to Russia.  His Fox News network has certainly been effective in softening up an already semi-ignorant, apathetic public and creating the hyper-partisanship that now exists.  Without this, the Russiansâ€™ efforts would have failed as they always have.  Even now, Sean Hannity and Fox News tries to indict the FBI and the Justice Dept. on behalf of Trump.  Stunning.  And the Republican Party not only fiddles while flames lick at American democracy, they now choose to fan them.  And still no public outrage.â€œYou have a Republic, if you can keep it,â€ù said Ben Franklin in 1787.  That remains to be seen.",February-11-2018,5

125,"I bought the Kindle version last night, and as a result got almost no sleep. Michaelâ€™s Wolffâ€™s thorough research and excellent writing makes it hard to put the book down. As I watch the train wreck that is our current political state, I often wonder what is motivating those who surround the president. Mr. Wolff helps answer that question. This book is a must read (and hopefully also a call to action) for every American.",January-6-2018,5

127,Confirms much of what we know about this man.,January-13-2018,5
128,"My expectations weren't high, but I was pleased to see that this book was closer to a work by Bob Woodward than it was to a series of gossip columns.  While it lacks the thorough research and thematic approach of Woodward's books, this is in part because the White House it describes is in a continuous state of chaos, resembling a medieval court with an unprepared king at the helm.  I read it in three days and wish there had been more.  The frank criticisms by Wolff or those he quotes of Trump and some of his closest advisors ring true, based on what we've learned about the White House from news sources and Trump's own statements.  Anyone who wants to vote responsibly in the 2018 or 2020 elections should read this book.  Even if you discount the accuracy of some of the information, it's impossible to deny the overall impact of the book.Drawbacks:  There are a few minor editing mistakes, probably from rushing the book into print.  There is very little from the Ivanka/Jared Kushner viewpoint.  It would have been better to have more input from sources independent of the various West Wing factions, such as reporters, congressmen, and Hill staff.",January-13-2018,5
129,"I bought the book. I'm not sure I'll ever read it. I doubt it's any different than the Regnery crap, but Trump tried to prevent it from being published. It's worth sending $15 to show him we don't do that in America.",January-5-2018,5
130,"Most of us who have been paying attention already knew the Trump Presidency was bad. This book just drives home how bad it really it is.Although it reads like a trashy tabloid style celebrity bio, it's pretty hard hitting and apparently very well documented. It makes President Trump look like someone who at best is in completely over his head (and possibly mentally unstable at worst), surrounded by cynical ""supporters"" who seem to be in continouos eye-roll mode at his behavior while still enabling him.Interesting weekend read.",January-6-2018,5
131,I shudder at the future conversation I will have to have with my grandchildren in explaining how a mentally unbalanced con-artist was elected President of the United States.  President Donald Trump is an American mistake far surpassing all other mistakes this country has ever made.

I donâ€™t know a lot about the New York political scene so I learned about a lot of the characters, the backstories and context of why their current positions matter and fit (or donâ€™t). It was also interesting to have a recap since so much has happened in the course of the past year. Read it for the content, not necessarily the writing as it could have been more tightly edited but it was still fascinating.",January-20-2018,4

The book is flawed by some poor editing and there's much here we've already heard about in bits and pieces, but it's a very useful snapshot of a bizarre moment in American history.  So much has occurred in these last eighteen months, it's been hard to keep it all straight so this book will remain a good reference and reminder.",January-6-2018,5
136,My hard copy cost me $18 that I gladly paid. Trump has no business being in this office. He lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes & the electoral college was likely rigged in his favor. Hoping impeachment will be coming soon as it seems unlikely that he will resign. The damage he is doing to this country will take another generation to repair.,January-9-2018,5
137,"Take it for what it is: the account of a single writer's time behind the walls of Trumpworld, the things he saw, heard and was told. That doesn't necessarily mean everything in the book is 100% accurate, nor is it the final word on the Trump presidency. But the very fact that this book exists at all is proof enough of the underlying thesis that the White House has been in disarray. I can't think of similar books being written after the first year of previous American presidencies.",January-8-2018,5
138,Fun book that shows a picture of the white house as it probably is but republicans are trying to keep quiet,January-12-2018,4
139,"I cant give this book enough praise knowing what Wolff was putting up with while publication of this piece must of been agonizing. When it starts the rollercoaster begins. Only problem is not even the writer can tell you how this will end. I among many I suppose  have speculated what trumps white house looks like and I have to admit, its so much worse than  I thought. In depth character analysis of all the big name players that actually are tasked with running this country is almost surreal.  Beautiful job of painting the vivid picture of the circus that is the Trump presidency.  Do yourself a favor and read this book soon.",February-16-2018,5
140,"Wolfe writes so well, much better than anticipated given early reviews.  He is facile and engaging.  The bookâ€™s content has been challenged by the establishment press yet I know the author stands by all its factual content,  In any case, I believe he has brilliantly captured the sense of both Trump and Trumpâ€™s White House.  Some of his vignettes had me laughing hysterically, but beyond the humor I want to cry.  The painful reality is this president is grossly incapable of handling his office.  For me, Trump has been the poster child of everything that is vulgar and decadent in our society since the 1980s.  He is morally repugnant and his anti-intellectual disdain for his high office is a tragedy for our great country.  His impeachment cannot come soon enough, and Wolfe should celebrate his role in contributing to that eventuality.",March-1-2018,5
141,If even fifty % of this book is true it's a damning insight into the collapse of the US empire.,January-26-2018,5

However I would add that if you think you have heard most of the details by either reading the reviews or watching and listening to Michael Wolff on television as he did his book tour you will be pleasantly surprised.,January-25-2018,5

144,"Donald Trump's miniscule attention span, intellectual shallowness and massive narcissism should be no surprise to anyone who has read any of the Trump biographies or who closely follows the news. Fire and Fury has a few choice quotes and scenes from the Trump Whitehouse, but overall the sad truth is the book is boring. Almost all of the good parts in the book have been covered by publications like the New York Times and the Washington Post.I finished the book, but I was really skimming through it. There is not much meat in this book. The definitive book on Trump, a President so disastrous that he makes George W. Bush look good, has yet to be written. That book will not be written by Michael Wolff, who is little more than a bitchy hack writer.All this said... I bought the book as a political act. Trump will hate the fact that the book is a massive success. Trump also made a pathetic attempt to suppress the book. Both were motivations in my purchase. But if you want a great read, look elsewhere.",January-23-2018,3
145,"Although there may be some specifics that are open to challenge, the evidence of the book is convincing and makes an overwhelmingly strong case that the key appointees of the Administration are more often than not grossly unqualified for the positions they occupy, anti-Science, anti-fact, and committed to agendas favoring a selected few. The book highlights how Trump's lack of knowledge and experience for political office is appalling and his blind commitment to ideas such as the wall and dismantlement of environmental laws horrifying. Can someone please move us forward in time to the next Presidential election? This book ought to be required reading for every American, unfortunately much of his base, like him. doesn't read collegiate level books or articles with multiple viewpoints. It was the Roman Senator Seneca who said ""Many might have attained to wisdom had they not assumed they already possessed it"",certainly the case for our self acclaimed genius.",January-11-2018,5
146,"Got it on audible so I could listen while driving/traveling.  Wow! Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. The narration is great.  I read that Trump's got his lawyers suing to get this book pulled. Wasting his time on lawyers, the horse already left the barn.  highly recommend it.",January-10-2018,5
147,"Mr. Wolff hustled the hustler and boy, is he ANGRY!  I find it hilarious!  That's not why I pre-ordered the digital download; I did so because I was curious, at first, to see if everything I THOUGHT I saw, I actually saw.  As it turns out, Mr. Wolff has confirmed that I actually did.  The strange thing is that, immediately following my feelings of validation and vindication, a severe depression sank in.  Yes, it's really THAT bad; Yes, they really DON'T know what they're doing in D.C., Yes he really IS worse than Dubbya! Forty-Five promised a ""truly historic"" administration, and by all accounts, he really hasn't failed; only in the opposite way in which I'm certain he meant.  His approval rating is historic in that it is the LOWEST recorded.  Psychologists are reporting historic levels of depression and suicides.  The tension is palpable... I know I don't need to go on; after all, this is about the book.  I'm having a hard time, getting through the book because I already know everything, having watched it closely.  The daily news (and I do mean ""daily"") is hard enough to keep up with and takes enough of my time.  For 366 days, now, every single one of them has been another catastrophe, another headline absolutely worthy of the attention of everyone in the country!  I feel as though our attention is literally being held hostage by this man because I'm AFRAID to turn away!  What if civil war breaks out while I'm trying to just enjoy a movie?  What if he finally pushes into a nuclear war while I'm at the park with my kids?  How will I know what to look out for if I'm reading a book about what happened a year ago?  Mr. Wolff, thank you for doing what every journalist should be doing, which is to tell the truth, regardless of what it may mean for their future invitations to the White House.  I understand how and why you did it the way you did it and I understand the reasons behind their actions, as well and I think that what you did was remarkable.",January-22-2018,5
148,"This book was incredible. How does this White House function? Obviously, the White House does not operate normally. Different factions are trying to gain control and influence. Nothing is coherent. We are left with Stephen Miller and Hope Hicks, who recently drafted a letter defending a serial domestic abuser. While reading this book, I clearly understand why no one in conservative circles wants anything to do with this White House.  Stay away from this train wreck. I loved this book because we see the inner workings of dysfunction and chaos. Trump and his enablers suffer cognitive dissonance.",February-12-2018,5

If some of it is true, and I believe much is, we're in big trouble.When you vote for someone who is so blatantly misogynistic, racist, childish, and completely amoral. this is the chaos you get. This man has no curiosity, lacks compassion, and watches way too much television. I don't hate anyone but he's the type of guy who could bring out that emotion in me. I've decided to limit my exposure to his lunacy to the bare minimum to preserve my sanity. I've never done this before no matter who's in office but not this time. His inauguration was the first in decades that I couldn't/wouldn't watch.This administration is the nightmare I thought it would be and I'm just counting the days until it's over.",March-19-2018,4

152,"By the time it took the author to interview all the persons involved, transcribe their statements into a readable text, and then have the book published the news is no longer 'new'.  As a political 'junkie' there was very little that I read that was noteworthy.  This is the man, Trump, who I have studied with dismay over the past two years, this is the circus of people he has surrounded himself with and these are the abhorrent actions they have taken.  If you have lived in a cave or under your bed for the past year, this is revelatory.  If not, it is simply a history book of recent actions...............",January-22-2018,3

This book shouldnâ€™t surprise anybody accept those blinded by their fantasy ideological view of the world.  This is still an important book and one that everybody should read.  It is a close up look at the dangerous dysfunction and chaos.  Americans need to educate themselves so we can stop this and prevent it from ever happening again.",February-16-2018,5

156,"While reading this book, I would (1) suddenly burst into laughter, (2) shake my head in disgust, and (3) gasp from shock. This book is a must-read. Where this book ends, more things have happened, and Wolff needs to write a sequel. Maybe he'll title it: Fired and Furious?",February-23-2018,5
157,"I loved this book. It talks about all the people that have influence over Trump, & the people that influence him the most. Also, the people that had no idea he would ever win, & in fact didn't want him to win. Offers insight on what can happen if there's an administration that knows the in's & out's of politics, & what happens if the administration doesn't know anything about politics or the constitution. The people advising him doesn't know what they're doing either & the ciaos it causes in the White House.  If we have a president that knows the constitution & knows what he/she can do legally, how much smoother things will go.The best part in the book is the saying:""What emerges is a portrait of one who has accumulated everything he wants, even the Presidency, and yet who does nothing to enrich or empower the citizens whom he ostensibly governs on the behalf of preferring to enact revenge on his perceived enemies.""I couldn't have said it better myself.Thank you.LB",March-5-2018,5
158,"When this book was first released, there was a lot of speculation and commentary about the salacious nature of the White House, and how exciting this book would be.  There was also a lot of caution that therefore the book was not to be trusted.  My experience in reading this book was that it was balanced, and matched what I was familiar with from other sources and what is available for all of us to see and experience.  It is a well-balanced account of what is going on inside the White House, what we are paying for with this family, and what we are risking in having elected this family.  Trump's family and his cronies all have a well-documented history, and it is not a good one. Some things are funny:  who wouldn't laugh at the name Jarvanka for the combo of Ivanka and Jarad as they stroll around the grounds or climb the steps to the plane?  But for the most part this is a well-documented observation of the tragedy that we live with.",March-13-2018,4
159,"This is not a condemnation of Trump's policies or ideals, it's the stunning revelation that he *has none.*The author traces Trump's vanity, instability, neediness, and inability to connect cause and effect through the first nine months of the administration, and leaves us with an undeniable conclusion:Regardless of your political beliefs, regardless of what happened with Russia, regardless of how you feel about Democrats, this man is not fit to be president.",January-6-2018,5
160,"The level of level of thought provoking process this book presents is worthwhile the read!  There should be a continued much more open process into these issues and incidences of those who should instead - be there to serve our Nation - not themselves!Mr. Trump was an easy read from the start and we as a population chose not to personally investigate!Tells everyone - ANYONE CAN GROW UP TO BE PRESIDENT! SCARY THOUGHT, HUH?",January-18-2018,5
161,"I bought this book because the President made a big deal over it's publication. Attempts at censorship are un-American.This book is so much more than the 10 or so quotes that made it around the news shows. I recommend this book for people who even just want entertainment. Bannon is hilarious. His quotes had me literally loling. I would pay to read a book of Bannon just talking about history and politics, very colorful speaker; removing f and s bombs, high school English teachers could use his words to teach the lessons on figurative language. Ie, this White House will make ""Shakespeare look like Dr. Seuss"" or that Cohn in trying to gain Bannon's support for a promotion is ""licking my balls"". How did that quote not even make it to the news cycles? That tells how much else there is in the book.As far as guessing the accuracy of the book, the many exact quotes that can only come from someone present in the middle of what was going on, or speaking with people who were present. If he made this stuff up, many insiders would have filled defamation lawsuits. Trump threatened, but didn't follow through, which makes the descriptions credible to me.I did come away from this book feeling really sorry for Hope Hicks. She is probably an individual who is loyally serving her boss and thinks she is doing right, but she his been used by a corrupt boss making her do his bidding. She will need a lot of therapy when this is done. Manafort, Kushner, Ivanka, Flynn, Sessions, Don Jr, Trump, if they all go down, their greed and lack of ethics are glaring, but Hicks appears as someone who is motivated to be loyal to to someone she trusted.A lot of the book exposes the infighting within the administration. In particular a major claim that a lot of the major leaks were from the factions trying to put down the other facion ( ie, Bannon vs Jarvanka). Some of the info put context to public events, such as Trump actually wanting to be at the White House Correspondence Dinner, even checking in real time about the jokes, but his aides wouldn't let him because they knew he could not handle jokes.",January-18-2018,5
162,"They all come across stinking of unfathomable hubris, perhaps Bannon the worse for showing zero loyalty (albeit to someone undeserving of one iota of loyalty) My impression is that things were so wild and crazy that it was hard for Wolff to keep up. Since the book confirms the atmosphere I've come to expect (after a years worth of reporting from multiple sources) it was easy for me to forgive the haphazard aspects (repetition, typos, guesstimating, etc.) throughout the book. It was a fun read.",January-15-2018,4
163,"This book may not survive the ardent fact checkers on every point, but it surely presents sufficient evidence of the mess we are in because of the election, with or without proof of collusion with the Russians, of Donald Trump as president.  History will certainly document the misadventure and monumental error of a misguided American electorate. This book will do much to reveal the thinking of those who had witnessed and were eager to tell the truth of this folly in the White House.  An important read to understanding how greed and entitlement led an angry, resentful backlash that foolishly enabled a wholly unqualified, mentally defective, immorally bankrupt narcissist to hijack the Republican Party, and to set our Democracy on the path to destruction.",February-8-2018,5
164,"This may not be the celebrity tell-all that our President wants, but it's the celebrity tell-all our President deserves.  Written in a style more typically used to describe life in the Kardashian household or by a pro wrestler writing his memoirs, this quick read puts all the well-known incidents of the past year into a single narrative.  If there is new information in here, it's the extent to which the insiders of the first few months dished each other to anyone who would listen.  And baby, I'm all ears.  This is a guilty pleasure, but I'm not too proud to say I loved it.  Loved, not liked.",January-19-2018,5
165,"I bought my copy of Fire and Fury as soon as it became available then intentionally took my time finishing it so that I could savor each chapter. My worst fears have been realized thanks to Michael Wolff. How Trump ever allowed him in the White House so be one of the great mysteries of our day. Thanks for enlightening us, Mr.Wolff. Where have you gone, Harry Truman?",February-19-2018,5

167,"Pretty much verifies exactly how I expected things are operating  within our highest office. Well written, flows nicely, and easy to read. Not really any great surprises, but I imagine it might be shocking to those who were not already willing to see the handwriting on the wall. Oh wait......those people will not believe the author's experience anyway, so my previous comment will not apply to them.",February-9-2018,4
168,"I know. Michael Wolff is a slimebag. He lied to get inside, and there is no way to have that detailed of conversation from 3rd party recollections. These truths self evident, the book is a must read for those who follow the news cycles. Much of what I read and wondered about what was going on behind the scenes at least confirmed the jist of what I imagined. Also, it confirms that collusion is not what will bring this whole thing down, it is money laundering.",January-20-2018,5
169,Mr. Wolf can thank Donald Trump for being his best promoter of this book.  Just downloaded it onto my Oasis  and read in one sitting because I can't handle Bigly words.  Had POTUS just acted like a grown man  been dignified and showed restraint on twitter.... many would not have paid attention.  But who am I kidding there's a child in the White House who can't help himself and clearly will never grow up so there you have it.  This book is quite revealing and  sadly what most of us already suspected.  Trump is neither a genius or stable contrary to his tweets.,January-6-2018,5
170,"I suspect this book is more talked about than actually read. If you havenâ€™t read it already, all the salacious cussing and badmouthing has already been blurbed in the media, so you wonâ€™t get anything new in that regard. Iâ€™d still read the book.It provides a brisk portrait of many of the key players in the Trump administration, with a dramatistâ€™s appreciation for their, well, drama. It also provides some back room insight into kingmakers like Ailes and Murdoch, whom you may have heard less about. Last, some of his hot takes on various subjects, from media to the Middle East, are worth the read. Heâ€™s no political analyst, but he does have insights.That said, like any contemporaneous political account, this is clearly a rushed book, there will be parts youâ€™ll choose to skim past, and it has a very short half-life. If itâ€™s still the first half of 2018, Iâ€™d strongly recommend it. After that, who knows what additional drama will have ensued to make this book seem hopelessly dated.",January-16-2018,5
171,"I enjoyed reading this book, although there weren't that many surprises in it  for those who have been watching the news these past few months. I expected more direct quotes and I had a difficult time keeping track of who was who, which is certainly not the fault of the author.Regarding the content, I don't know enough about the DC scene to evaluate the truthfulness or accuracy of this work, but it seems consistent with information provided by reliable news reporters (not Fox!).  Can't understand why our elected officials are putting up with this so-called president and  am very disappointed in the politicians who are allowing this administration to continue.  Where are their backbones?",January-26-2018,4
172,"It is fun to read even if you can't stand Trump. It gives ""huge"" insights into how his mind (doesn't) work and what his character (or lack there off) is truly like. It reads like a high farce and I at times I can't stop laughing at the insanity of it all.",February-1-2018,5
173,Great book.  Prove money does not buy class. Trump is a baboon. Moron,February-6-2018,5
174,"Like watching a train wreck, the book left me wanting to hear more.Most of what he writes about you've already read about in the NY Times, Washington Post, or Wall Street Journal but having found so many people in the White House willing to speak unfettered to Wolff, you'll get many more details.You can't say the people of New York City who knew Trump very well didn't try to warn the rest of the country that he was nothing but a con artist. But like rebellious teenagers, they had to ignore the elites (""Who are they to tell us what to do."") and get taken hook-line-and-sinker by the guy. Now they're doing mental gymnastics to try to continue defending and believing in the guy.What a mess we're in.At times hastily written and not the best English, but you know you're not reading it expecting ""War and Peace"" quality.",April-21-2018,5

176,"I didnâ€™t think I would enjoy reading a book such as this, however, was quite surprised, as I couldnâ€™t put it down. This would make a great movie...a serious movie. After reading the novel I can say itâ€™s believable and if one really thinks logically it becomes impossible to say â€˜thereâ€™s no way real people can be this ruthlessâ€™. Fire And Fury will enlighten you on how American politics works. Iâ€™d say the author did a pretty good job in the way the events are told.",January-27-2018,4
177,Unbelievable book. Terrific pricing. Those of us who are slckened by Trump will be even more shocked. Very sad commentary on POTUS .Horrified at the state of our Country now Read the book and make up your own mind,January-16-2018,5
178,As a citizen of an ally of USA I read this book with disbelief of the vile selfishness of the main protagonists and the seemingly lack of a system that could handle such a situation. Looking in at the sight of such primitive tribalism reinforces Edmund Burkeâ€™s premise that â€œit is necessary only for the good man to do nothing for evil to triumphâ€ù,January-24-2018,4
179,"I am on chapter16 of this book.  Probably one of the best books I've read.  It gives a fly on the wall perspective.  Just to think that our GREAT PRESIDENT allowed someone to have all access in the Whitehouse without any questions asked is just comical.  The book basically confirms everything that has been said in the past year, with more juicy details.  It's well worth the $15.00!Cheers!!!",January-9-2018,5

His infrequent use of â€œcharacterâ€ù identifiers often left me confused about who said and/or did what. The book felt rushed, and somewhat unpolished but I enjoyed it just the same because of the priceless information I couldnâ€™t possibly get anywhere else! Thank you, Mr. Wolf, for sharing your story with us.",March-12-2018,3
182,Excellent read. The book only confirmed what was known about Trump which is that he is a racist skinned thin con artist. His only concerned is to enriched himself family and cronies.,February-5-2018,5
183,"This book basically fills in details of the Trump campaign and the subsequent response to the victory. In some respects, it's shocking.But most of it could easily have been predicted by even a modest examination of Donald Trump's entire adult life. The only thing one might find surprising is the possibility that Trump himself might have realized his galactic ego obscured the distinction between wanting it and having it, between getting enough 'buyers' to put him in the White House and actually doing the enormous job of BEING the President of the United States.",February-12-2018,5
184,"Over the past year Trump has clearly shown the world the type of president and man that he is. The 71 year old World class Narcissistic, Unqualified, and Incompetent man should not be commander in chief and one of the world leaders.

How this sexual Neanderthal is getting away with his continued sexual abuse and harassment, which is not investigated and reported in detail; and 2. How this poor businessman, who went bankrupt several times, surviving on other peoples' money and greed, is now accessing the richest pots of money in the world (the US treasury).",February-10-2018,5
186,"I loved this and the other book on Storming The Whitehouse.  This was fascinating and a quick read.  Would love part 2 to continue this amazing soap opera/ wrestling match of a presidency.  Trump is genius, just not a well read one probably.  Bannon is right as was Pat Buchanon 20 years ago, this country is a battle between 2 tribes.  They win because we liberals are 2 stupid 2 play the game.  Like someone said in this book, liberals donâ€™t show up to a gunfight with a knife, they show up with tea.  One tribe will dominate and the other will be irrelevant.",January-26-2018,5

188,"The main reason I bought this is because it was so obvious it struck a nerve with the president and this administration. The more they discouraged the reading, the more intriguing this book became. Although many details are not completely accurate, it rings true in the overall sense that this is the Donald Trump I have observed for 25 years. None of it is a surprise and there is much more that will come out in the days, months and years to come.",January-12-2018,4
189,"An ""unusual"" read!  This book was, indeed, a serious look into the political issues of the current administration..... my ""best guess"" is this ""ride"" will continue to be crude and ""bumpy""....for it's duration!!!

190,"Provides a fascinating insight into Trump and the White House. Yes, I already knew about these events, but knowing more about peoples' characters, their actions, and their interactions helps make sense of the events and tells you how certain decisions came about. Actions that seemed downright crazy before now have a context that makes them seem more plausible and sometimes even inevitable.",January-25-2018,5
191,"Probably not the most literary or even most accurate book about politics, history, etc. that I have read but most of what I read sounded likely to be accurate.  I can certainly understand the reason that most sources preferred to be anonymous.  The sad thing is that, given the actual facts about the current occupant of the White House, it's easy to accept that Mr. Wolff's info is not just fiction or intentional falsehood.  My only complaint was that the book could have benefitted from better editing but I know it was rushed to market.",February-16-2018,4
192,"I follow current events, perhaps too closely for comfort. My husband bought this book to catch up on the disaster that is the Trump Administration.  He noticed many typos and mistakes that came from the rush to publish the book. We received the book from Amazon sooner than most Americans could get a copy.  After Hubby finished it we donated it to our local library because they couldnâ€™t obtain a copy and there was a long waiting list.  The vivid descriptions of people and events were effective for teaching my husband who is who and who did what.  He can follow the unfolding events now as if he had been paying attention from the beginning. Yes, it is one personâ€™s take of what happened, but very little of it had been successfully contested. Itâ€™s a good resource for someone beginning to learn about current politics.",March-21-2018,5

198,"Yeah I know some of the details may not be accurate, however I find the preponderance of the narrative to be compelling. This is mostly because of Trumpâ€™s reaction to the book and the case Trump makes against himself every day with his Twitter feed.  If anything, I actually feel better about Trump after reading this book, or at least sorry for him. Mr. Wolff, please continue to chronicle this â€œunpresidentedâ€ù train wreck until the wonderful day when we are free of this insanity.",January-16-2018,5
199,"I am neither a big Trump supporter or detractor, and I am sure that not all the information presented in the book is accurate.

200,"As for what's inside the book, yes, it's messy.  But ""Fire and Fury"" is also utterly riveting.  So, yeah, buy this book as a vote against tyrants attempting to tell you what you may or may not read, and buy it because it automatically gives you membership in the new, accidentally created national book club.  But also buy it because it presents a vivid and alarming tapestry of information pertaining to the man running our country, and those who surround him, that none of us can really afford to ignore.",January-6-2018,5
201,"The book has much more material than I thought it would have. I thought it would just be about the time that Trump has been in the White House but the author covers campaign events and people and incriminating stuff from before the election - when you see it all laid out one thing after the other - if you're not scared for the country, there's something wrong with you.",February-5-2018,5

203,"Not very well written, from a copy editor's perspective. It was also interesting, and informative, and I loved hearing about the shenanigans of the current administration. It supported the negative things I have heard/thought about Trump and his White House staff - basically, they are a bunch of money-hungry, selfish, manipulative, uncaring, ignorant, uneducated fools. Nothing has changed since I finished the book. Keep in  mind that this book is based on opinion, not fact. I would compare it to reading People magazine, or other Infotainment - it is NOT news.I was compelled to buy this book after hearing that Trump tried to prevent Amazon from selling this book. I will never buy another book by this author due to the poor writing.  I agree with the reviewer that mentioned the writer's unfortunate use of overly complex vocabulary. I have a BA in English and am a medical copy editor, and have read extensively my entire life. Some of the words chosen made me say ""whoa!"" in my head, if you know what I mean.",March-7-2018,3

211,"For anyone who has been following the life and times of The Donald, the clown show of characters and antics won't be much of a surprise.  Much of the juicy parts have been covered in depth on cable news and in print.  There are still a few surprises, but mostly it's a reinforcement of things you already knew or suspected of this half baked administration and the puppeteers behind the scenes.  There was a big uproar when the book first came out, some dismissals or dismay over various tidbits of information, most of which-like the Steele Dossier-have born out to be verifiable and true, or unable to disprove.  I found it a good read, I wish I could just laugh off some of the crazier parts, but the deeper we get into this administration the less humorous it becomes, and the more ominous the future.",March-13-2018,5
212,Got mine Friday on kindle.  Very well written.  I pray that every Republican in Congress gets voted out for allowing this demented fraud of a man to run our country.  HOW DID THIS HAPPEN.....,January-8-2018,5
213,"Like so many before me, I give this book five stars because I can, because being able to purchase it is a very gratifying exercise of free will and the First Amendment.I would not give the author's style five stars; it is inelegant, uneven, and requires the reader to labor at gleaning his meaning at times.Wolff's intermittent use of uncommon, multi-syllabic words leaves the impression that he used a thesaurus to make his work more journalistic/scholarly.That being said, this book is a fantastic read, as many have said.  Most of the ""revelations"" have been revealed in the press; what we learn is how the pieces connect, how the various factions in the WH have served to create an atmosphere of chaos that, combined with Trump's unpredictability, have paralyzed this administration.  The competing ambitions of Bannon and Jarvanka (Jared and Ivanka), and their effect on the presidency, are well described and put the seemingly contradictory messages from the WH in context.Wolff's summary of the events of the past year is a long list of ""crazy"" whose details bear repeating, breathtaking and stunning, even for those of us who have avidly followed the news.  And Wolff's focus on Trump's thought process, mercurial spirit, and motivation, as seen through the eyes of the underlings jockeying for his favor, sheds light on the administration's inability to deal with the institutions and mores of Washington.And my concerns that, given the press coverage, the book would not be worth reading, were unfounded, there was still plenty of material to digest.",January-7-2018,5
214,"Wolff tells a story that is not hard to imagine happening. We follow his line of thinking throughout the book and it jumps around a bit because he sectioned the chapters by peopleâ€™s relationships rather than by a sequence of events. I found this to be a drawback on the book because Iâ€™d read about the inauguration in an earlier chapter then touch on it again from a different angle in a later chapter. Just tell me everything about the inauguration then move on to what the first 100 days was likeâ€_in order. But even with the relationship based structure, the book reads well. I found it to get very stuffy towards the middle as if someone else was writing it or editing it. There was also a distinct infatuation with Steve Bannon. I am not sure if that is because Wolff was getting most of his information from this source and therefore, Bannon became most of the story but it is very evident that Bannon plays a large role in Trump politics.From the beginning, the campaign is covered closely and I found the most interesting part to be Melania and Trumpâ€™s relationship (or lack thereof). It definitely gives credence to what we see in the news, the distance, the lack of affection. Second in interest was the fact that Donald did not plan to win or even wanted to win. He just wanted the publicity and the attention so that his businesses would continue to flourish. This was speculated many times by my own friends in discussion when he would do things or say things so off the wall as if he was trying his best to throw the electionâ€_and simply couldnâ€™t. From this book, it affirms that this was the case and that Melania had strict reasons for not wanting to be the First Lady or be in politics period. She enjoyed her life at the top of the tower and felt this was unnecessary (which it was from her point of viewâ€_if you have everything, why try to take over the world when it has already worked in your favor?).Next, we get to see the inner workings of the White House when the presidentâ€™s kids are given no titles but all the power. We see what life is like without a meaningful Chief of Staff, without an effective communications team (because they get sidelined by a president that doesnâ€™t vet a thing he says or does with people who are knowledgeable) and basically what turmoil and the Wild Wild West looks like, politics-style. It was very interesting to read this bit of information the most because the cat-fighting and leaking, the blowups and the jealousy from all sides (Bannon to Jarvanka then Trump to anyone that got good press when he didnâ€™t). Itâ€™s like reading about a Rugrats adventure. Totally enjoyable but wholly scary when its real.The book doesnâ€™t give a ton of new insights. Most everything in it has been leaked, investigated and shared via media. So that takes the stinger away that we would have had in normal, more protected administrations. The only thing you will gain from this book is the relationships. You will see how people interact, what they really think about the president and his family (which is no real shocker since most of America feels the same way) and get an inkling as to why some people were chosen to serve, why they stayed or left and what they think about Trumpâ€™s service to the country. Overall, you will get ZERO political understanding of Trump (and maybe, thatâ€™s because there isnâ€™t any) but you donâ€™t read this thinking youâ€™ll understand what policies he supports or whatâ€™s important to him. You wonâ€™t get that. This book paints Trump as an entertainer. His main goal being to get on television and be liked by all. No policy (because thatâ€™s ran by Bannon and whichever family member he trusts at the time). No loyalty (because he fires people that donâ€™t look the part, smile or generally kiss his a$$). No organization (because he promotes people with no experience then reams them for not doing well). So the book just feeds into our fearsâ€_that the White House is in complete disarray with a few folks trying to hold it together at the seams.",May-3-2018,3

219,"This book has had a huge impact, while not affecting much of anything.People who were said to have been somewhere or having said something have disavowed anything and everything. But the overall amount of ""source"" contributions result in an exceptionally scary situation in the White House.This book is a good read for those who are against Tromp.  I don't think those who support him would want to read this book, I will go so far as to say it is a must read for those who make up his extremely large base.",January-16-2018,4

222,I would recommend that all Americans read this book!  There is so much happening under the cover that we have no idea about! Our very democracy is in peril!,January-19-2018,5
223,Great book on how horrible Donald Trump has made America.  I blame two factors the Deplorables which will only be deplorable to allow the worst human being on this earth to be an American President.  Also the younger people who thought we had two flawed candidates.  I hate mass shootings but the kids in Broward County will make a difference for our future.  The second Fire & Fury will be about a country that doesn't under stand no matter the degree of mental Illness guns need to be take away and no one should be allowed to buy an assault rifle,February-26-2018,5
224,"GR8 read, a real page turner.  Michael Wolff said publically 100% of it's true.  Only ""disclaimer"" at beginning was to state that so many around Trump lie, bigly, so he had to ferret out the truth from many different accounts that were similar with different details recalled.  Read this book, it's an important part of our history.",January-16-2018,5
225,Very good insight into the tragic circus called the Trump Administration.  Like being a fly on the wall.  From reading the book I have much better understanding of the destructive idiocy that occurs on a daily basis.  I recommend it for all.  Read it and decide for yourself.,January-27-2018,5
226,"Only up to Ch 6 so far... I am obsessed by finding logic in all things and, to date, Trump has been a mystery to me. The things he does and says make no sense. Michael Wolff has helped me understand WHY Trump is president. HOW that could happen. WHAT that means for our times.The audiobook is well presented and easy listening.",January-12-2018,4
227,"There is nothing in this book that hasn't already been reported through multiple outlets, but it is handy to have within a single edition. The news cycle in this administrations is so rapid that it's easy to forget how it all started.Not a huge fan of this author's writing style, but I'd rather he profit from the compilations rather than Bannon (who appears to have sourced a lot of this). It's a bonus that it riled 45, and that alone is worth the price of the book.",April-28-2018,3
228,"This book is as enjoyable as all the hype surrounding it. Finally, a fly-on-the-wall expose of just how dysfunctional Trump and the current administration truly are.",February-13-2018,5
229,"What fun!  I read this for the entertainment and think it was well written, which somewhat surprised me after all the criticism I had heard.  The assertions Wolff made seem to hang together well and seem well supported.  If there are minor inconsistencies, I don't think there is anything wrong here that could possibly change the story that is told by this book.  The scenes Wolff report seem much like those we see on TV everyday, but we can't usually know what is going on in the background.  Now we do know.",February-6-2018,5
230,"We've heard most of this stuff, but when it's all layed out within context of the staff infighting and trump's immaturity, it's much worse than I ever imagined.  And I already believed he was an existential threat to the world.",January-7-2018,5
231,"Is it perfectly accurate? Depends who you ask, but the overall image created of the president and his white house is undeniable. All the craziness makes much more sense when you see who he is behind the scenes: a spiteful vengeful man who doesn't have a clue how the government works and doesn't care to learn. Of course they'll claim everything is fake, because it's not flattering, but it all matches up to what we've been seeing too well. That aside, it's well written with a quick pace, and entertaining as hell.",January-24-2018,5
232,Great book. Really tells it like it is inside this Whitehouse. You can tell this is indeed exactly what was going on. Author has great creditability especially compared to the book's focus. But it does make the GOP (my party) look really stupid for backing this man in the way they did. Clearly unfit for public service at any level.,January-10-2018,5
233,"one has put pen to paper , I trust that the reporting is derived from actual knowledge and experience. It is my hope that many Trump diehards read this accounting which will have a bearing on their support.",February-15-2018,4
234,"I just finished (Kindle edition).  Wolff largely confirms what anyone with a pulse already knows.  The man occupying our nation's highest office has the temperament of a two year old.  But that's not what the book is really about.  On the contrary, Wolff' primary focus is what the men and women who have the task of caring for this two year old think of him. And the answer is damning.",January-7-2018,5
235,"Exceptional document of historical dysfunction! Hopefully a prison cell awaits this scumbag family soon!Riveting, couldn't put it down! If half of it is true we're in deep trouble! Impeach #45!Makes Frank Underwood look like a pretty good and competent leader! lol.",January-10-2018,4
236,"Excellent read. While Wolff's sourcing has been questionable, in your heart of hearts, you just know that no less than 90% of the tales in this book are completely accurate.",January-19-2018,5
237,"If you closely follow the events surrounding the Trump campaign and subsequent administration  much of the narrative of Fire and Fury fits the facts. Of all the alarming observations made by Michael Wolff, perhaps none are more so than the insight into the probable amount of collusion with Russia. The path of the Mueller investigation through Jared Kushner will be interesting to see if it happens as the author and Bannon predict. The subsequent demise of Bannon in the wake of the publication of this book only lends additional credence to it. Of course, the massive number of lies and misinformation generated by the White House has decimated my trust in the Presidency, but the amount of poor journalism in response has made a complete quagmire out of accuracy and truth. Wolff was given, for whatever reasons, access to the inner workings of the Trump presidency and too much of it rings true to be dismissed as fake news. I highly recommend that you read the book with an open mind and decide for yourself the validity of the book.",January-11-2018,4
238,"It all rings true to me, from what we have seen and heard with our own eyes and ears. I found the book to be well and entertainingly written. I'm taking off a star because I thought it could have benefited from a tad more copy-editing.I'm sure I am not alone in feeling a mixture of guilty pleasure and deep revulsion in reading Fire and Fury. This is way beyond partisan politics. We have a disturbed child as president, constantly angry and resentful, focused on nothing but himself. I hope to God that we get through this in one piece. He clearly cares nothing about the country, the planet, or any living thing on it.With all the writing that has been done about Donald Trump and those in his orbit, Michael Wolff's hits the hardest.",January-7-2018,4
239,"If you're a political junkie - this seems to be a pretty good look into the bizarre world of the Trump Whitehouse.While I suspect more than a few of the tales told are somewhat embellished, I have a feeling that there are a lot more crazy things going on, that aren't being told.It's mentally difficult to read. I'm not sure if that's because I'm getting burned out on the whacky or if it's a case of Michael Wolfe's writing style.Your experience may vary.",March-12-2018,5
240,"Whether you think this book is entirely true or not, there were whole public speeches that were made by Trump that were quoted in the book.  The author could not have made that up. Just reading what Donnie had said publicly is quite scary.  The man is an absolute moron.  How did he become President?",January-28-2018,5
241,"Michael Wolff has logged a living nightmare, and even Mo, Curly and Larry would be appalled at the slapstick episodes that now form part of US history and its government.",January-22-2018,5
242,"If you wonder what the hell is going on in the White House and if Trump is as screwed up as you think then this is the book for you. Don't believe the deniers and spin doctors from the alt-right. Mike Wolff was there in the West Wing with free access for months. Read it, get the facts and decide for yourself.",February-10-2018,5
243,The president is a wack-a-doodle.,January-21-2018,5
244,"This is the first time I've read a book based on an ongoing reality TV show. It does give great insight into all the drama not shown on the show. ...and I must say, this is the most exciting Trump reality show yet! I'm just sorry that it's true.",January-5-2018,5
245,"Well written, an interesting read and I found it to be very believable.... Unfortunately.",January-18-2018,5
246,"When you add a lot of righteous anger over economic displacement, xenophobia often with a racist foundation, and general well--deserved dissatisfaction with WA DC, the door was opened for the strangest election I can recall in my 65 years. Mr. Wolff was given extensive prolonged access to the warring parties in the Trump White House. The book ""Fire and Fury"" is an alarming look at what happens when the techniques of Gaslighting and Media manipulation puts someone in charge who only cares about his own egotistical need to dominate every confrontation. The strongest message is that no one was more shocked by the election outcome than Trump followed by his campaign staff. They were caught completely unready. I came away from this book feeling like this was a frighteningly clear look at how easily the institutions of government can be subverted in an age of popularity based not on principle but upon how outrageous one can act in every situation to gain attention. We have a long way down yet to slide, but Mr. Wolff has provided a valuable insight into a White House ruled by a pure Narcissist. I feel sorry for all Americans; we are still losing the last Election. (Note: I also blame Hillary and the DNC for this mess.)",January-22-2018,5
247,"A must read......just like a ""Watergate"" story in the making....",February-14-2018,5
248,"Here is President Trump's review via Twitter: Michael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book. He used Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!I just finished the book and I realize that Michael Wolff's tactics don't stand up to top journalist standards, but there is enough there there to paint a picture of a constitutional crisis in action. Trump is unfit to be president. All evidence suggests this.",January-6-2018,5
249,Required reading.  The movie's going to be awesome.  Bannon is clearly the main leaker/talker in this tale and it's hilarious/terrifying.  He really does want to burn it all down and will go to any lengths to see that happen.  Jarvanka needs to be in jail.  Dumpster fire Presidency.,January-8-2018,5
250,"Just started reading this, and like most reviewers here, I purchased the book as a protest.  Americans have to do everything possible  to get the message to the GOP leadership that we demand they stop pretending that this is normal.  History will judge them harshly for putting political power and personal gain ahead of protecting our democracy.",January-6-2018,5
251,"First half better than second half.  It began to drag after the midway point but I did manage to finish it.  Trump lovers will of course hate it and Trump haters will like it, up to a point.  Again, a bit draggy after the mid-point and Wolff used a few words that I deem $5 words.  My vocabulary is EXCELLENT (seriously) and there were a couple of words I actually had to look up. Five dollar words should only be used in highly literary works NOT in something for the general public.",February-11-2018,3
252,"I've seen several interviews with Michael Wolff on TV.  He is not always articulate and he refuses to actually verify what he has written.  Still, most of it jives with what we've all seen in the headlines and on the news, just more background.. (Unless you watch Fox, which is the epitome of Fake News!  Do they think pretty girls in short skirts spinning tales while behind the camera they have to watch out for their own tails is informative?)Anyone with eyes and half a brain knows Trump has got almost no brain and very little talent, other than his own self-aggrandizement. The book gives a logical look into why things have gone as they have.  Hold onto your hats folks!  If Trump makes it the full four we will either be in a world war or he will be living 24/7/365 on the golf course with Jared and Ivanka running the country.  Take this book as sugar to help the medicine go down.  And vote for ANYONE else next time!",January-21-2018,4
253,"Michael Wolff spent months inside the Trump White House, often hanging out on the couch in a common area, talking to people, but also simply listening.It's important to note that Wolff has a reputation of being a somewhat sloppy reporter, not always reliable. It's also important, though, to note that no one mentioned in this book has denied saying what he attributes to them in this book. There are disagreements over interpretation, but not over what they said. Other reporters, with better reputations, as well as other people with access, say that while there may be inaccuracies of detail, the overall account rings true.Steve Bannon, now out of the White House, and indeed having further torched his standing with his failed support of Roy Moore's campaign for the US Senate in Alabama, was his main point of entry to the White House and apparently his major source. That's a possible source of bias in the gloss that gets put on the facts.Overall, this is an alarming picture of a White House in chaos. It's fascinating, revealing, and scary. It needs to be taken with a few grains of salt, and compared with other accounts and reporting as they become available. Nevertheless, it's an important contribution to understanding what is going on in our government and why.Recommended.I bought this book.",March-31-2018,4
254,"The amount of inside info presented is impressive. The criticisms of this book donâ€™t hold much water, since you really couldnâ€™t make this stuff up.  The only negative is that the book ends too soon. So much has happened since then, it would have been fascinating if Wolf had had continuing access to the West Wing.",January-26-2018,5
255,"Helps to make sense of all the fragmented messaging, deceitful actions and incoherence of judgment spewing from the Whitehouse and those in Washington trying to keep it afloat. Might be good as a horror read if it didn't have such life and death ramifications for the US population.  When the various narratives are tied together  from an insiders view point, the confusing thoughtless messaging  we saw from the outside looking in tie together in a logical way as plausible  explanations. Good read overall.",January-18-2018,5
256,"It's worse than I thought.The Trump presidency.That's the only conclusion from reading Fire and Fury, by Michael Wolff.  However, it's maddening to read about the ""inside"" conversations and not know exactly which ones Wolff heard firsthand and which ones he got second or third-hand.But the infighting, trash-talking, and... the management of our government by people who are clueless!  Maddening!",May-4-2018,4
257,"I'm not sure where to start with this review. You see a lot of what's happening in the White House on a daily basis, the actions the administration takes, what unexpected thing 45 says on any given day, the high turnover rate, and you wonder: What on earth is going on in there? This book gives you some insight. I do think you have to take some of the details with a grain of salt, however. While I completely believe there is a lot of basis to what you read in this book, there is probably also some bias -- not necessarily on the part of the author, but with those interviewed. The WH does appear like a dysfunctional organization, where loyalty means very little. Given the circumstances under which employees there are required to attempt to function in, I can understand their frustration.All in all, this was an engaging read. There were parts I skimmed over. There seemed to be a seething distaste for Ivanka and Jared, which I'd surmise comes from Bannon (and one can definitely sense his influence in this narrative) and that slant got a bit tiresome, while other important players in the administration were glossed over.This should probably be read with a healthy dose of skepticism; however, as information comes to light with time it will be more possible to sift fact from opinion. A lot of what I read here though does resonate with what I actually see playing out. I simply couldn't pass up reading this, as this is such a critical time in the history of our nation. Not a good time, but a time that will shape what we believe in and are willing to tolerate from our leaders.So, I'd say this book is worth the time. I won't forget it anytime soon.",January-26-2018,4
258,"This book is well written and interesting.  I've followed the Trump presidency closely.  Too closely.  I resolved in 2018 to quit reading all of the articles about his horrible administration.  Instead, I resolved to read more books in 2018. Then, Mr. Wolff wrote a book which allowed me to continue my obsession without breaking my resolution.  Even so, I might not have bought the book until Trump tried to stop me from buying it.",January-6-2018,5
259,"The core narrative comes as little surprise to anyone who has followed this presidency. That said, it does expose the massive level of infighting and jockeying among the various members of his cabinet and how almost all of the news stories that came out were leaked either by Bannon, Jared or their lackeys.",January-25-2018,4
260,"""This was the peculiar and haunting consensus--not that Trump was guilty of all that he was accused of, but that he was guilty of so much else. It was all too possible that the hardly plausible would lead to the totally credible."" These two lines from ""Fire and Fury"" sum up Wolff's entirely cringe-worthy tome. No wonder Trump and his allies attacked it so vociferously (and in the process made it a best seller). Trump consistently comes across as a man who never grew intellectually or emotionally beyond the ego-centric wants and demands of a seven year old and Bannon as his gleeful abettor. Yes, there were glaring factual errors (people with similar names mixed up, etc.) that should have been caught and corrected, but overall, I think it provides the reader, in this era where the president of the US lies with impunity on a daily if not hourly basis with a very intimate and appalling view of the Greek tragedy that is the Trump white house that has an unshakable ring of truth to it. It is an important addition to the history of the Trump administration and the smoking wreckage it will leave in its wake, forever changing and not for the better the institution of the US presidency, the US as a nation, and the world as a whole.",January-16-2018,4
261,"Reads well seems to be true based on inexplicable actions that occurred. Really will be something else when Mueller keeps making deals with ex members of White House of Cards. The finger pointing and sell outs should be remarkable. One thing seems sure no one likes anyone in the White House right now. Too bad, So sad. â€œMake America Great Againâ€ù looks like a foreign plow. Other countries donâ€™t care for us. I wonder if they would com3 to our Aid if a conflict broke out with China or Korea.",January-19-2018,4
262,Truly enjoyed the book. It clearly showed how this administration is cut throat and a know nothing. Thin skin President.,January-10-2018,5
263,"The author is more clever than I expected. The details presented grab your attention and stimulate your curiosity and awe.Michael Wolff provides a foundation for the who, what, how and why of Donald Trump. Lots of material for learning, discussion, criticism, investigation, fact checking, debate and awakening.A very interesting and important book. After all, Trump is the president.This book will be talked about for a long time. It has just started. Americans need to quit staring at phones and TVs and wake up.",January-9-2018,5
264,"As I told a coworker, this is deliciously gossipy, yet (as a liberal voter) horrifying. Yes the news does give him more press time than they probably should, but American voters need to know what's going on. Bias happens everywhere, but censorship is wrong.",January-12-2018,5
265,I nly 10% of tis is true it i s still jaw dropping in revelations. How can anyone support this administration?,January-23-2018,4
266,"This book provides intriguing context on the lunacy of this presidency. Fascinating to learn how even Trump's inner circle is (and likely always was), well aware of his cognitive and emotional impairments, yet perfectly happy to exploit this bizzare chapter in American history for personal ambition and greed.",January-5-2018,5
267,Worth the time to read. Anyone interested in what is going on in the administration needs to read this - Wolff provides insight from a unique perspective.,February-20-2018,5

269,"Anyone who does not feel anger and sadness at the travesty of our current administration will hate this book.If you, on the other hand, want to know what really goes on in the White House, read this book.

271,"The media coverage and the flurry of author interviews at publication have ruined my reading experience.  Unfortunately,  most of the juicy revelations had already been exposed and widely discussed by the time I read this book.  That was a mistake on the part of then promoter and author, in my estimation.  I did enjoy more indepth glimpses of the inyeractions and motivations of the unholy triumvirate: Bannon and his followers, Jarvanka, and the president himself. What a cluster @*#$!",January-21-2018,3
272,"The book is a real eye opener.  It should be called how to make Millions at the Tax Payer's expense.  Granted there are minor and major factual errors in the book. Michael Wolff has admitted so in the press and TV. I believe the title comes from words the person in the White House said when referring to North Korea. It reminded me of something I learned in High School.  We were reading ""Macbeth"" by Shakespeare  There was a line that seems to fit today.  ""Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,  That Struts and frets his hour upon the stage,  And then is heard no more. It is a tale,  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,  Signifying nothing.",February-21-2018,5
273,"It's really sad to read what has been written in this book about the current occupants of the white house. Even if some of what Wolff has described could not be verified, the majority of what he  has written rings true as more and more embarrassing news comes out of white house on a daily basis. You read it with a sense of anger and sadness and wondering how on earth people would find the buffoon worthy of becoming the president of the free world with all his corruptions and lies and childish behavior. It's a strange time to be alive for sure.",March-4-2018,5
274,"Based on the early criticisms of the book's author, I actually liked this book more than I thought I would. It's still a wonder to me that he could have just sat around in White House offices through all this turmoil, but it is testament to the chaos that surrounds Trump and his unruly staff. Though I was familiar with most of the events described, still it was interesting to be able to view the inner workings of activities and staff rivalries. While I'm sure Wolff tried to be everyone's best friend while he was there, no one comes off particularly well in his telling. Before reading the book I had nothing but contempt for Trump or anyone who would lower him/her self to work for him. That opinion has not changed. Most of them don't appear to like him, but I suppose the money is good. One person who bears future watching is Nikki Haley and her rather strange and excessive praise of Trump.",February-22-2018,4
275,"Michael Wolffe's account of the happenings inside the Trump White House is an undeniably entertaining view of the outlandishness that is the Trump presidency. As unsparing a portrayal as I have ever read, Trump comes off as an aberrant president barely involved in the job he was hired for. Not since the civil war has a presidency so divided the American people. Fire and Fury shows us why Donald Trump has become the king of discord and disunion.",March-5-2018,5
276,omg BUY IT its freaking JUICY!!!!!,January-5-2018,5
277,"Review written 1/11/18. On the one hand this was an informative read. It's also information I don't entirely trust. Other journalists have said there are mistakes here, in the reporting. On the other hand, I couldn't look away. Because I read this on the Kindle and my phone, it was easy to highlight passages and words. At first, it was every world of criticism of the president, but there were just so many. This week he melted down in various ways around this book. He has tried three days in a row to play the part of being presidential, but yesterday, in a meeting on immigration, he infuriated many everyone with a soul or who isn't a racist by insulting African countries and Haiti.While I was reading this book, the author was on Stephen Colbert's show. He apologized two weeks ago to his publisher, he didn't think anyone would buy the book, because everyone knew it all. I pay attention to the news, I knew a lot of it, I didn't know the details. I didn't know that in Trump's first year in office, he had three competing, snarling, ingratiating, appeasing people acting as Chiefs of Staff: Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon and Jarvanka, or what Bannon calls Jared and Ivanka Kushner.",March-19-2018,5
278,"This is a very interesting book.  It is not really as critical as claimed, but seems to give a fair representation of what Wolff observed.  It is in fact more sympathetic to the President that I had anticipated, and more critical of Steven Bannon than the news portrayed it.  In particular, it creates a sympathetic portrait of Jared Kushner and the difficult position that he is in.  The pressures must be enormous.  In addition, Wolff provides interesting background and context for what you read in the news.  Very easy and occasionally funny read.  Wolff is a good writer and paints vivid pictures, which help one understand what one reads in the news, which is often given without context.",March-2-2018,5
279,"Learning more about ""goofus"", he is more of a child than I even thought.  Such an egotist, always wanting constant attention and adoration.  Should never have been allowed to run for the esteemed office of President of United States.  Totally unfit.  This book will blow your mind.",January-27-2018,5
280,"Although there's an appreciable amount of conjecture and filling in the blanks, a fascinating read.  I found it interesting that Wolff described Trump' s use of the word, ""genius"" as a put-down, yet two days after release of the book, Trump described himself as a ""stable genius"", in an obvious attempt to discredit the book.",January-6-2018,4
281,Excellent,January-5-2018,5
282,"Great book....  Yes, much of the information has been seen or heard in the news, but having it all in one place has an incredible impact.",January-11-2018,5
283,"If you're following the news at all then you're probably already familiar with the most shocking bits of this very relevant book. Wolff's style is sometimes a little scatterbrained and structure-wise it could have done with some more revisions to create a clearer through line. Nonetheless, this is a book you want to read for its content, not for its writing style. I know there has been a good bit of controversy around what's real and what's been tinkered with but you don't have to be a genius (dare I say, a stable genius) to be able to figure out where Wolff has taken some liberties.",January-22-2018,4

Surprised that Steve Bannon spoke so freely and is now â€œsinging a different tune.â€ù  Politics is ugly and Trump was and is still unfit to be in the position of President of the United States.

290,"Style of writing very readable, fills in many stories in a plausibly believeable way. I loved that at the beginning of the book the author laid it all on the table in an honest and open manner; what could be true, what is true, which parts from interviewee's were questionable, etc. This should have quieted some criticisms from other media people about the quality and truthfullnes in regards to the book.",January-15-2018,4

292,Interesting inside info on who's who in Trump's world. Easy read for poli-sci buffs and history buffs. Looks like we're in for more upheaval in DC!,January-19-2018,4
293,"This book is no piece of editing brilliance, and I might've ignored it until the interviews and the attempts to cease and desist. My gut tells me there's a grain of truth to this nonsense. I voted for 45, and I regret it.",January-22-2018,5
294,"before i purchased this book i read detailed reviews and agree with their views. great book for anyone who wants to learn how the Trump administration is running the country and White House... can now understand the chaos atmosphere. hope one day someone who works in the white house in the staff quarters may right a book. what love to know their views in serving the current president family. book to me doesn't have much malicious attacks on anyone, which I find pleasing. though don't really enjoy the cursing yet then i am showing my age.",January-7-2018,5
295,I felt like I was watching a Marx brothers movie about a comedian who decided to run for President as a publicity stunt. He then runs a wacky campaign full of ridiculous characters and finally finds that he has been elected. What then occurs as he tries to assemble an administration full of more hapless individuals who are all trying to manage him with their own agendas and fighting each other would make a hilarious comedy. If only it werenâ€™t so frightening!,January-15-2018,5

298,My own fears and beliefs in what is going on in the Peopleâ€™s House was verified in this book! Recommended reading for every American of voting age.,January-12-2018,5
299,"This book deserves a Pulitzer, not only for its delightful, engrossing prose, but because it's possibly the only offering of a coherent, logical picture of What Is Happening that's been offered to the American public. The one suffering from shock and emotional pain wondering whether they're going crazy, and if not, why the so-called political adults won't put an end to it. Turns out it's because high-wattage attention seekers are all the same. Whether ordinary Americans are living or dying, able to feed themselves or drowning in poverty, doesn't matter to them -- they'll prop up Satan himself if doing so allows them their games. Their chuckles. Their sense of importance. This book perfectly captures the picture, and perfectly tells the story, of the public's pain, regret and utter confusion that is the result of possibly the most perfect political hubris in American history. Every American would do themselves a favor to read this book and consider it self-empowering for the next cycle of elections to come. Because if these yahoos can make it all the way to the White House...",January-8-2018,5
300,"Very interesting look inside a chaotic WH...and the dysfunctional environment. The relationships among key players and the never-ending grab for power are no surprise. If even half of this book is true, it confirms the lack of leadership at the top. Thanks to the author for sharing.",January-18-2018,4
301,This book is a good read and I will recommend it highly! it unlocks the intrigue surrounding the presidency and will certainly change our concept of the White House! thanks to a author for his diligence and research and for his description of this narcissistic man. We are indeed indebted to Michael Wolff! This book is a must read!,March-2-2018,5
302,Loved this book!  All the crazy and scandal you'd expect in a well written book chronicling the downfall of this country and the presidency.,January-14-2018,5
303,"While it could have used a bit more editing (some typos, unnecessarily run-on sentences, too many nested phrases), obviously rushed to press due to Fat-Ass-Donny-Two-Scoops' silly threats, I give this a full five stars because Michael Wolff has done something that news journalists have been unwilling to do: pull back the curtain to reveal the scummy, revolting truth about the current Resident of the White House. Bravo, Mr. Wolff!",January-20-2018,5

305,"Even if only half of the content of this book is real, it is a terrifying look into the inner workings of the Trump White House and Trump's inability to think, plan, or lead. The stories of Palace Intrigues are as compelling as those of monarchs of the past and 20th century facists and modern dictators.An entertaining read in spite of the fact that it is not fiction and the effects of this administration will take decades to repair.",January-20-2018,5
306,Confirms a good deal of what we have expected. What is impactful is how the book puts it all together. Since we have been subjected to the daily drip drip drip hilarity of the Trump circus.,January-11-2018,4
307,"Well written, fun book. It's a howl to read how incredibly stupid the Dumpster and family are. Makes Bannon out as a genius in the story. And the filthy wealth of the Kushner Family. Pays Harvard Law School 3M and another university another 3M for a diploma when he's dumb as a rock!  Heaven help us! Plus I bought this book because NOBODY is going to infringe on my 1st Amendment right to tell me what I can and cannot read!",March-13-2018,5
308,"I took about 2months to read and digest this book. I am a staunch anti-Trump individual and am still dumbfounded he won. However, I recognize he did win the electoral votes and has a base of voters.  I had to set aside some of my bias and look at why some of these people would want to give up jobs, money and positions to be part of this dysfunctional administration. Why do they put up with it?  Power?  It usually is.  Read it. It is interesting.",February-7-2018,5
309,An excellent book!  Well written and right to the point on problems with this administration.  The only difficulty I can see is that too few people will dive in and really read all that's available about what's happening with the government and what can be done to make changes.,January-22-2018,5
310,"The book is entirely credible, especially for those who have kept up with the daily news. It offers a plausible portrait of this least qualified person to ever hold office and manage to embarass a nation and discredit its international standing as a model democracy.",January-19-2018,5
311,"Several of the stories in this book have been verified by other sources and seem to be common knowledge, especially regarding the infighting between Bannon, Priebus, Jarvanka and others.  Additional very specific situations were new to me, but very believable. Although there are some statements that weren't verified, most of them were quotes from people directly to Wolff himself.  I have no problem with that.  If I had edited this book, I would have corrected some typos and shortened some of the long-running sentences (often with many hyphens).  I found this book to be very enlightening and disturbing.  It confirms my worst fears: that 'our' President doesn't read, cannot track complex briefings, is verbally abusive to virtually everyone, has an extremely short attention span, has the vocabulary of a 2nd grader and almost no knowledge of the U.S. government and the world around him. Interesting information about Jared and Ivanka and their highly questionable, if not downright shady, business dealings. Not sure how I feel about Wolff's characterization of Nikki Haley. This book is worth reading!!",March-13-2018,4
312,This was a great book!  Got all the behind the scenes dirt.  I found it confirmed the thoughts that I had looking in from the outside.  It was very well written.,January-23-2018,4
313,"This is a fun read, if a bit alarming when you consider the dysfunction running rampant through the White House. A great deal of the information in it seems to have come from Steve Bannon, so no wonder really that the Mercers have ceased to have very much to do with him since the book came out. I read this concurrent with the new revelations coming out about Cambridge Analytica, which has Bannon's and the Mercer's fingerprints all over it. Seems like we've just seen the tip of the iceberg re electoral shenanigans, and Fire and Fury is a good place to start to understand just what those shenanigans have reaped for us mere citizens.There is a lot in here, so the presentation is somewhat frenetic, almost as if it's racing to keep up with developments as they happen. I thought it would be more gossipy than it is, and on balance, it actually seems quite thoroughly documented ... although understandably, without attribution. I wouldn't call it balanced, but then the administration itself is unbalanced so how could the book be otherwise? On the whole, well written, smart, (I made extensive use of my dictionary) entertaining, and informative.",April-1-2018,4
314,Michael Wolff's book is perhaps one of the most frightening books of the year about the Trump presidency. The inside look of President Trump's first year is frightening and terrifying more than any of Stephen King's horror novels combined. The fact that it's true is worse.I was only five classes away from a second Bachelor's degree in political science. Never in my wildest dreams do I wish for somebody else to be President at this time. I was surprised in reading about Vice President Pence and his wing in the White House as being structured and functional in comparison to Trump.Trump's illiteracy about government and politics is painfully obvious when he brought up Rosie O'Donnell in a Presidential debate. Trump is clueless about reality and the political world.I don't know where Trump's presidency is headed for but this book paints a terrifying picture of an unstable ill-equipped man to handle it. He shouldn't have gotten the Republican nomination nor win the election. He didn't get alone. He had millions of enablers as voters who voted for him.,April-5-2018,5
315,"I found Fire and Fury to be a revealing story about Donald Trump's presidential campaign, marred by Russian meddling, and his presidency.  I kept up with the 2016 Presidential Election and  news events related to Trump's presidency.  Michael Wolff takes us behind the scenes in the West Wing to understand the cast characters, fighting among themselves for power in a chaotic administration, and a President who seems to treat our nation like a big reality TV show.  If you are an avid Trump supporter, this book is not for you.  For everyone else, you will find Fire and Fury to be very revealing.",February-23-2018,5
316,"There was nothing that I read in this book that hasn't already been substantiated by the current administration in the last year. While I have no doubt there may be some exaggerations or even a few lies, if just a few things are true, which indeed many recorded occurrences have been confirmed as factual, we should be deeply concerned. The mere fact that there was an attempt to stop this book from being published is horrifying.",January-15-2018,5
317,"Finally, we get the same story, w/more detail, from inside the WH!  All I can say is how could this even remotely happen? Well, Wolff has told us the story (in vivid detail). I believe him. He knows his craft. He is highly respected. He is an award winning author. His perspective is totally unique as â€œFly on the Wall â€ù w/the bossâ€™s full permission!  That alone shows the seriousness of the trouble weâ€™re in when an incompetent unpredictable egotist is making, changing his mind and the truth, and then drafting something entirely different into law! Party aside, this is a MUST read for ALL as a lesson in how strong a democracy must be to survive an illicit president.",February-12-2018,5
318,"I sense a rush to publish in this work. It is at times repetitive and would cause me to stop and say, ""how can Wollff know what person X thinks?"" I wish he had fleshed those suppositions out more. He is a lively writer, perhaps, like too many British authors in my experience, too attached to the use of french phrases.Much of what is key the drama of ""Fire and Fury"" has been reported much more carefully than in Wollf's book. However, Wollf's prose is that of the insider. The picture of the Trump White House he essays comports with numerous reports from verified stories, and credible reporting by trusted sources. That is the scary thing about the book.",February-22-2018,4
319,"This book provides insight and background of Mr. Trump and what motivates him.  Also, a light is shined on the power hungry players in the theater of the absurd which is Washington, D.C. Well worth the read.",January-19-2018,4

322,"This book is hard to put down.  It answers questions about various incidents and explains why the administration has, at times, seemed to hold diametrically opposed political philosophies.  I highly recommend it to federal employees and inside-the-beltway news junkies.",January-27-2018,5
323,"A fascinating and compelling look at the current administration from a writer with 'unusual' access. Moving, at times at whiplash speed, from Shakespearean tragicomedy to reality TV to Borgiaesque intrigue to Simpsons episode and back again, this tale will keep you turning pages. You may want to ask why, with all the other titles available concerning Mr. Trump et al, this particular volume exacted the greatest amount of hysterical screams of Fake News, lies and denials, which massively increased sales for Mr Wolff. Perhaps the 'Trumpers' protest to much? Read the book and judge its veracity for yourself (with perhaps a little non-partisan fact checking).",March-8-2018,4
324,"Just finished the book and found it completely rings true for what we have seen out of Trump and the people around him over the last year.  I think it also make a good case for its central premise:  Trump and the people around him never thought he would win.  And because he never would, people like Maniford were brought in, who on the face of it, were bringing baggage that would be a problem once elected, but, since Trump getting elected couldn't possibly happen, was not a problem.",January-20-2018,5
325,"It was a great read.  This book gives you an idea about what goes on in the white house.  It shows  how sometimes being a professional is what is needed, or maybe if your not so into yourself and hired people that know the job you would be better off.  I think GOD save us from Trump.",February-13-2018,5

327,There are few surprises in this book. We know the story. But Wolff is a great writer and a terrific storyteller. An enjoyable read.,February-5-2018,4
328,"Extremely well written, very intelligent, non stop action, great detail and full of very important information. It was mind boggling.",January-12-2018,5
329,"As expected, there are no real surprises in content, and nothing implausible in the book's claims about the Trump campaign's lack of expectation or desire to win the election, Trump's utter incompetence or unprofessionalism in the job, the in-fighting and petty fiefdoms that arose among Trump's equally unworthy Cabinet, the view from seeming supporters that Trump is an ""idiot,"" the unethical machinations of the Trumpkins to parlay the presidency into more money and power for themselves, the zanies with whom Trump surrounds himself because he really can't recruit ""the best people,"" etc. etc.Any objectively attentive observer of the Trump campaign and presidency has long been able to see that he is unfit for the job of U.S. President, always was, and that he did not really hope to be elected to it or to do any actual work if he were.  Wolff's book confirms this with details not evident to those outside the Trump White House or inner circle of confidants.  These details are often fun to read, in a Schadenfreudian sort of way -- though I would still rather have an admirable President who can keep up with the job than a risible one who is dangerously out of his depth and taking us all down with him.What is striking about the book is the degree of specificity, which sometimes beggars belief.  Wolff explains how he comes by the information he has, including recordings of conversations -- and others have confirmed the sieve-like nature of the Trump White House when it comes to leaking information.  But it is still odd to read direct quotes from meetings and private conversations, or from White House staff being so bluntly candid about the nincompoopery of Trump and his ""team.""  Did they really say these things to or in front of Wolff?More than that, Wolff's novelistic style of writing includes descriptions of things he is unlikely to know, like the interior monologues or emotional states of those he describes.  He goes beyond strictly objective journalism in that regard.The one thing that IS surprising to me about the book is the number and frequency of errors in orthography, punctuation, and usage -- and the creakiness of Wolff's syntax.  At least once every three or four pages, a word is misspelled or misused, quoted errors are not flagged with a ""[sic]"", Latin and French phrases are not regularly italicized (but are preciously over-used), compound adjectives are not consistently hyphenated, the distinction between ""who"" and ""whom"" is ignored, and comma placement is almost a free-for-all.  Meanwhile, Wolff's favorite sentence structure, though usually coherent, tends annoyingly and unnecessarily to separate subject and predicate with long, sometimes multi-level dependent clauses and phrases.  More than once, having made my way through a nested series of subordinate clauses, appositives, non-restrictive phrases and digressions, I had to go back to the start of the sentence to remember what Wolff was talking about.  This became increasingly irritating.I know the book was rushed to distribution to both avoid and take advantage of Trump's attempt to stop its publication, but the editor whom Wolff thanks in his acknowledgments still could have done a better job.  If Wolff's publisher, Holt, is looking for a new editor for the paperback edition, I'm willing to do it -- for a price.",March-3-2018,4
330,This is a great inside look at the crazy man in the White House. It is fascinating to read about the intrigue inside the Trump administration.,January-23-2018,5
331,"This book will be required reading in a few years. Political Science majors will be handed this book as a ""What not to do"" in politics.",January-7-2018,5
332,Reading this is like reading a tabloid. Lots of gossip and snark. Plenty of revealed secrets of the stars. A satisfying confirmation that all the received wisdom about Trump is true--unless it isn't. Enjoy the book--it's lots of fun-- but look for better resources when it comes to judging this president and his administration.,January-16-2018,3
333,"Thanks to 45â€™s tantrum, I purchased and read the Kindle edition in a day and give it 5 stars. Truthful or not, it is highly believable and sheds light on the opportunism/desperation of 45â€™s familyâ€”which will no doubt go down with the defective patriarchal ship. Tweeting itâ€™s â€œa bunch of lies to sell a book,â€ù our ironic President forgets he ran a campaign using a similar strategy. See â€œArt of the Dealâ€ù on the many benefits of lying.",January-6-2018,5
334,"I don't like Michael Wolff's writing. ""Fire and Fury"" isn't easy to read. Wolff likes to spice up his sentences with inserted asides, sometimes 10 or 20 words long. It takes great concentration to capture every thought first time around. Then there's the commas. Boatloads of them. 99% are well placed but half could have been omitted. Many paragraphs say the same thing as the previous but from a different angle, with a different twist.Still, ""Fire and Fury"" is a gripping depiction which has left me with a question nearly as devastating as the miasma Wolff relates: How did he ever get in the door? Evidently the vetting you might expect of a journalist equaled that of nearly everyone else - nonexistent. All the chants of ""lock her up"" for emails no one has seen ring hollow considering the security in the present White House has yet to materialize.No one needs to read ""Fire and Fury"" to imagine our current administration couldn't be more dysfunctional. That said, to truly understand how messed up it all is requires diving into Wolff's book. Unfortunately this is one instance where knowledge is not power.",February-12-2018,4
335,"Yes, you knew most of this already. Yes, the book was rushed to publication, missing a lot of typos, grammar errors and likely some needed final edits. Yes, the last 50-60 pages are nothing more than a rant by Steve Bannon that goes on way too long. All those shortcomings aside, this is still a must read. I support Michael Wolff's efforts to show us just how truly toxic, crazy and insane this administration is, and the true feelings of those connected to it. Trump is way in over his head, has little to no interest in most aspects of the job, has an awful temper, has zero clue on most things going on in the country, and manages by chaos. The book starts when Rebekah Mercer brings Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway onto the team. At that point, Trump was down 20 points in most polls and looked like he would lose in humiliating fashion. Bannon and Conway help him get to a point where, while still predicted to lose, he was in contention. The circus begins when he does indeed win in one of the biggest shockers in election history. We learn a lot about Trump during this transition, such as his relatively weak marriage to Melania, his love of McDonald's, his enjoyment of TV and his love of talking on the phone. We see Corey Lendowski, Robert Flynn, Paul Manafort, Sean Spicer, Reince Preibus, Anthony Scaramucci, Steve Bannon and others leave the administration as it continues to run into issues mostly of their own making. We see some of the Russia investigation, the internal fighting between many of the team members, as well as alluded affairs (Lendowski and Hope Hicks, Trump and Nikki Haley). All in all, it's both hilarious and frightening at the same time. I recommend it so you know just how bad it truly is right now in this country.",February-4-2018,5
336,"This book, assuming the correctness of the sources, provides an incisive look at the daily workings, plotting, and unmatched incompetence seen in the White House since the dawn of swearing in of the 45th president of the United States. More than the President, this book shows the world from Bannon's point of view, who, with his signature forcefulness and the political insight, is definitely the star of this narrative. Conspicuous by its absence is any discussion on Mitch McConnell and the President's relationship and view of Vladimir Putin. If you're interested in knowing how the power centers in the White House were formed, evolved, and ended up at the end of the first year of the Trump presidency, and how various world events were shaped or created due to this dysfunctional White House with this undercurrent of incompetence flowing right from the very top, then this book will be an interesting read.",January-7-2018,5
337,"Everyone -- the Trump supporters and the non-supporters alike -- should read this book.  It provides those of us who are aghast at POTUS' behavior with helpful insight into what is happening in the White House.  But I also think Trump supporters will find it insightful.Have a dictionary handy -- the author is one of those people, apparently, who feels the need to demonstrate his knowledge of big words seldom used.",February-9-2018,4

340,"I marveledâ€”and not in a good wayâ€”when I watched cable news commentators announce The Orange Menaceâ€™s tweets denouncing this book, followed by his legal (?) counselâ€™s cease and desist letter and further nonsense about suing the author, publisher, and anyone else remotely associated with The Book for defamation.And thenâ€_ the wonderful announcement that the book would be available almost immediately, earlier than the original publication date.  So I pre-ordered the Kindle version, $15+/- and worth every last pennyâ€”and up it popped the very next morning.Very well, now Iâ€™ve read The Book.  Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t learn much that was new and exciting because Iâ€™ve heard quite a bit of it along the way since the (In)famous Announcement in June 2015 that a reality show host and real estate mogul was running for president.  Yet what I did see was some much-needed continuity, some definitive chronology, that put all the salacious, treasonous, and mind-boggling shenanigans into frightening perspective.  One thing leading to another and yet another by a cast of clowns dressed inâ€”mostlyâ€”designer clothes and wrapped in their own sinister hubris.I also thought The Book was much better than, say, the National Enquirer in hardcover. Picture it this way:  you curl up on an overstuffed couch beside someone who smiled, patted the cushion, and whispered, â€œIf you canâ€™t say anything nice about people, do come sit here with me.â€ù  Itâ€™s a gossip-fest from first to last, at times clever, insightful, stinging, snarky, and over-the-top.  You read sometimes with your mouth open, wondering how much of this Tell-All can possibly be true.  Who knows?  It is one of the hottest topics debated since the publication date. Iâ€™d suggest, however, that there is probably a kernel of truth to most of Wolffâ€™s interviews since too many outside sources have corroborated them to a significant degree.I found problems with The Book.  The rush to publish is apparent.  Not enough content and line edits, so I stumbled over typos, misspelled words, iffy punctuation, incomplete sentences, and quite a few repetitive passages. I get it, but â€œexplosiveâ€ù books ought to be perfectly presented, if for no other reason than to eliminate one reason to cavil about it.And I must admit that The Book is polarizing. You know this.  Folks who support the president will goâ€”and already have goneâ€”ballistic, denying every single word.  Folks who deplore the present Orange Occupant of the White House have their negative opinions validated.  I doubt that reading this book will change anyone's mind about the administration or its major and relatively minor players, although I can see it providing a veritable tsunami of talking points.Be that as it may be, I think itâ€™s worth a read, regardless of your view of #45.  I just wish it had added a bit of political analysis and gravitas to the highly entertaining Hollywood-style gossip-fest.",January-14-2018,4

343,Deep sigh. Sad really. It's interesting how this book brought generalized hatred to pathetic about the Trump  presidency. I'm skeptical of some details but overall theme is what it appears to be from the outside.What I am most still wondering though is who is running the government? It's clear he's incompetent and has no plans or people just approaching him? And the biggest question is when will this all end and how. I think the book is important in that it helps in wrapping your head around how in the world the bazaar unbelievable things that we hear about are actually happening behind the scenes. It makes sense now.,January-30-2018,5
344,"â€œThe notion of the Presidency as an institutional and political concept, with an emphasis on ritual and propriety and semiotic messaging â€“ statesmanship â€“ was quite beyond (Trump).â€ùSuch is the pall that permeates throughout this outstanding work by noted political journalist Michael Wolff. With unparalleled access to the 2016 Trump Presidential campaign and then his initial nine months in the White House, Wolff delivers a blistering referendum on undoubtedly the least organized or prepared Presidency in history. Led by, easily, the most incompetent Executive to ever occupy the Oval, weâ€™re witness, time after time and chapter after chapter, to the inner workings of those mind boggling acts of his first days and months. From his out-of-the-gate failure to reform Obama-care to the completely misguided, ill-informed and forced Executive Orders limiting international travel (the foolish â€œtravel banâ€ù), to the manhandling of immigration policy and his subsequent posturing on campaign promises for the â€œwall,â€ù we see constant staff in-fighting, maneuvering and one-upmanship for the Presidentâ€™s earâ€_all intertwined with Trumpâ€™s inability or lack of desire to formally organize an Executive Office with a clear vision.Wolff sets the tone from the very beginning with the urgent observation that the Trump Presidency is fraught with multiple internal issues, beginning first with Trump himself. Narcissistic, virtually illiterate and with the attention span of a small child, we see an Executive consistently bewildered and at odds with the many on staff who believe that they hold sway.And at the forefront of this inner chaos is Steve Bannon, the Presidentâ€™s â€œChief Strategist,â€ù a position created solely within this administration. An Executive Chairman for the small Breitbart News Channel but having no political affiliation or experience, Bannon nonetheless possesses a savvy and vision brought on by the hard political right. And it is this dogma that he pushes as the de-facto Trump base. Calling out the Tea Party while evoking his own tenet on issues such as American isolationism, he initially sells this vision of America to Trump who then bases his campaigns ideals on it and continues to adopts it as his platform as Presidentâ€_indeed, this strategy is so successful, it introduces Bannon as a sort of political â€œwhiz-kid,â€ù a definer of a new political movement. And then by gaining a key role inside the administration, Bannon goes into overdrive to sell this message throughout the West Wing and to set the Presidential agenda going forwardBut completely antipathetic to Bannonâ€™s vision is newly appointed Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Chairman of the Republican National Committee for the previous six years, Priebusâ€™s agenda is to steer the Trump Presidency away from Bannon, who Priebus considers toxic, and toward the mainstream Republican Congressional base, namely that which is dictated by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Much to his chagrin, however, Priebus soon discovers that he has virtually no support within the West Wing, particularly from the President himself, who, instead, seems to delight in openly mocking Priebus.Finally and perhaps dubiously, we have Trumpâ€™s family, daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner. Political neophytes all, Kushner in particular is a curious figureâ€_a Harvard graduate and JD/MBA from NYU, heâ€™d previously excelled in real estate before purchasing the short-lived â€œNew York Observerâ€ù magazine. But somehow, due to birthright and the Presidentâ€™s belief that among all of his â€œshort-busâ€ù children, Ivanka is â€œthe smart one,â€ù Jared, because the â€œsmartâ€ù Ivanka married him, MUST be worth listening to. â€œJARVANKA,â€ù clearly clueless, want nothing more than for their father to appear Presidential thus their entire mission is to shield, protect and offset anything and everything that will require him to actually think, analyze or spend a great deal of time or â€œbrainpowerâ€ù on. Thus they work tremendously hard to build a staff that, by definition, drastically offsets the efforts of Bannon and Priebus.And so with this ship of fools, it is, gravely, the American people who are inveterately affected. And as Wolff so dystopianly reminds us, through pages and chapters, all three of these factions spend colossal amounts of time in battle with each other for hierarchy, with the idea of actually governing or attempting to accomplish things like reductions in the national debt or a salving in the absurd amount of congressional partisanship being a foreign concept. And at the top is an amazingly out of touch and disaffected Executive who could not or even would not recognize anything amiss. Yes, Ronald Reagan was a completely over-rated President who did only one thing very wellâ€_he hired an amazing staff and was then smart enough to stay out of their way. This clearly disaffected President is not only obtuse but seriously embarrassing for the United States on the world stage, giving rogue nations like North Korea and Iran a boldness that theyâ€™ve not enjoyed previouslyâ€_seriously, if a country were proliferating WMD and/or nuclear weapons and the greatest power in the world was led by an inferior impersonator, would you be deterred? I think notâ€_And as for this eye-opening and thought provoking tome from Michael Wolff, my only commentary is to say thanksâ€_I, as an American citizen applaud your effort in exposing this buffoonery to the American people such that this â€œexperimentâ€ù can soon end. Hopefully, the highest of Trumpâ€™s transgressions (his involvement with Russia in his campaign win) will expose him for what he truly isâ€_a more severe Richard Nixon type, and that his actions will lead to unanimous impeachment in both Houses of Congress before he embarrasses us any further.",March-16-2018,5
345,"This book is very interesting. It does provide some insights into the inner workings of the Trump administration but it also has a gossipy flavor. Also, it is difficult to completely ignore some of the credibility issues of the author--yet, most if not all of it seems credible, both based on news reports and also just observing the public behavior of Trump and his minions. Also, kudos to Wolff for having the idea and carrying it through.",January-28-2018,3
346,"A great book, which could only have been written by someone inside, and viewed what was going on with a critical eye. Occasionally a little hard to follow because of all the players involved, but the essence is all too clear. If you're just flipping through it, go to Chapter 8 (Org Chart), or if you've bought the book, be sure you get at least that far. This is where you find out what defines the Trump presidency.",February-20-2018,5

350,"Good insight behind the scenes. Pretty clear that the sources were Bannon and his allies. Reading from a position of skepticism, I don't believe this is in any way fiction. Wolff clearly makes some interpretations, but the majority of the book is simply reporting the views and opinions of people close to Trump. Many of the events described are clearly the precursors to recent headlines, but I think that despite the hype, the importance of this book will fade simply due to the sheer volume of controversy generated by this President.",March-13-2018,4

Just the fact that the White House issued a cease and desist order on its publication is reason enough to believe there is plenty of disturbing veracity in this addictive read. It leaves one hoping the cabinet invokes the 25th, even though the prospect of a Pence presidency makes me think weâ€™d then be blown back to somewhere around 1750.",January-15-2018,4

354,"If Trump hated himself & were to write a book about himself, this would be it.  This book was difficult to get through, not well written, & seemed to contain a fair amount of hearsay.  Taken all together, this really makes it the perfect book to represent Trump & his leadership so far.  There were no surprises in this book, pretty much everything we already know, have heard before, or suspect.  As to whether everything was true, does it really matter in this new era where things are only true if they match what we believe or how we want to perceive the world?",March-24-2018,2
355,"If Trump hadn't thrown a tantrum about this book, I most likely wouldn't have purchased it. I wasn't surprised by anything I read, at all. It was a good read, and validated everything I've already felt to be true about the Toddler-In-Chief. If you're fed up with this country being treated like a game show, you'll most likely enjoy this book.",January-14-2018,5
356,"Trump Nation already hates it but for others, if you read it, nothing that is happening right now (mid-March 2018) is surprising.  Wolf stopped writing and the book was locked down and went to press in 2017, but the past actions he reported on foreshadowed everything that is going on now.Most recent big event, Gary Cohen's resignation.  If you read the book you'd say, ""Oh yeah, saw that coming.""  The sex scandals--saw those coming, too.  But the frightening part is the downright, amateurish ineptitude of the players revealed in the book.By the way, why is it still on the book shelves?  Trump was going to stop publication, but it still selling like hot cakes.",March-7-2018,5
357,"I purchased this book because the president attempted to stop its publication, essentially trying to ban it. We don't do that in the United States. So I happily handed over $14.99 (Kindle version) to author Michael Wolff and publisher Henry Holt and Co. Kudos to you for having the courage to write and publish this extraordinary book.Days after Donald J. Trump's inauguration as the 45th president of the United States, Wolff was given special access to the White House where he became the proverbial fly on the wall listening, watching, interviewing and recording what happened for seven months. He just sat on a sofa and paid attention. The bizarre part is that no one was on point in the White House hierarchy to tell Wolff to leaveâ€”so he just stayed. And that is why this book is so fascinating to read. While you already know the major plot points from Comey to Charlottesville, what you don't know until you read this book is what actually went on behind the scenes in the West Wing during these events. Find out who said what to whom and who influenced and manipulated Trump the most. Find out how much ego and emotionâ€”rather than analysis and careful thoughtâ€”play into the president's actions, decisions and those ubiquitous tweets. Find out the incredible morass of incompetence, chaos and confusion that pervades the West Wing.This is a compelling and riveting read that is not only incredibly frightening but also enlightening, offering a pitch-perfect sense of Trump's personality and how he functions (or not) as a leader. Today this book is a lesson in current events, but it will one day be a lesson in history. And for that reason it is worth reading.",January-17-2018,5
358,More in-depth look at those who are running(?) our government today....,January-29-2018,5

360,"Love Trump, you'll hate the book. Wolff had access to people inside the Trump inner circle, especially Bannon. The dysfunction and chaos is on full display. Even if this book is not one hundred percent accurate, it seems to confirm a lot of negative perceptions of the people and process that have been reported in the media. It is an easy read, and will reinforce the thinking of Trump opponents and will infuriate Trump supporters.",February-14-2018,4
361,"While the publication may lack research rigor, as claimed by many, a clear truth emerges that paints a questionable character for the elected U.S. president. But whatever the reader understands from anecdotes revealed in this book, a most depressing perspective of core American values presents itself in the inaction of the U.S. Congress to assert its constitutional power in the service of American citizens. That the entire White House consists of cronyism practicing a self-serving plutocracy is seen in this book as a conflict, not between government and its citizens, but between the Executive and Legislative Branches of government. The until now unchecked power absorbed by the President runs its own course because countervailing forces do not take it upon themselves to assure Separation of Powers - between the Branches, with States, and with citizen groups. The Grimm brothers could not have spun a more intriguing, yet frightening saga for the abuse of government power. The book tells it as it appears to be.",March-7-2018,4
362,I purchased because Trump told me not too...,January-22-2018,5
363,"When I awoke on Nov 9 to find that Donald had indeed been elected President of the United States, I was sick inside.  Each day since then, I have turned to MSNBC to ensure that I am up on whatever antics Trump and company are involved in that day.  Accordingly, there wasn't a lot in this book that I didn't already know.  The book merely confirmed the validity of my belief that Trump's presidency is and will continue to be the worst in United States history; that the US has become and will continue to be a laughing stock across the world; that Trump is amoral, racist, stupid, and out to do nothing more than to line his, his families', and his cronies' pockets.  There are a lot of typos in this book (which I attribute to a rush to publication), however, I believe that it is well written, easy to read, and adds meaningful context to what I already knew.  I'm looking forward to  Michael Wolff's sequel documenting the events leading up to Trump's inevitable impeachment and indictment.",January-12-2018,5
364,"Nothing in this book is likely to shock you if you've been following the news for a while. However, the critics who say it adds nothing to our understanding of the situation are wrong. Wolff does a solid job of describing the various personalities and shifting factions that go into the Trump White House much more cohesively and completely than anything else we've seen. He fills out our understanding of the items that ended up in the news, makes clear which leaks came from where, and helps clarify what seemed like (because they were) shifting loyalties. For example, I previously found the actions of Rosenstein during and after the Comey-firing debacle confusing, but that whole episode made a lot more sense after reading his explanation of the moving pieces.Definitely worth a read.",January-7-2018,5
365,"To anyone following the events in the White House (and the bankruptcy of the polarizing US political system in the slipstream) this book, apart from insider quotes can not be a surprise. It just illustrates what can become of a democratic political system if the dominant political parties, for the sake of clinging to power, influence and often selfish interest, refuse to modernize, where they should, across party differences share the responsibility of accountability to the people and the creation of a sustainable political system fair to all.",January-15-2018,5

Book has good insight into the everyday pandemonium there!!",February-28-2018,5

375,"Yes, I was one of those who had to get this book the day it was released. 8:59am found me, tablet open, waiting for the download to begin. From the first page of Fire and Fury I was hooked. Michel Wolff tells a fascinating story, not because we don't know a lot of what he reports, but because he exposes the context in which these well-publicized events transpired.Wolff has a sharp eye for irony, so much so that the book was often pretty funny. That said, an editor surely should have spent more time removing his non-stop parenthetical phrases. Many times I had to read a sentence repeatedly just to connect thoughts broken open so the writer could drop in another aside.This is my only complaint about the book. If he writes a sequel - and I hope he does - (see now he has me doing it!) I'll be there, tablet in hand, first thing in the morning on publication day.",January-18-2018,5

379,"This book was trashed by Trumpites as full of lies because it contained several factual inaccuracies. Those really don't matter. What matters is that Wolfe captures considerable information and relates this information (with attribution - no ""sources say"") in a narrative that shows an overall theme -- the Trump White House is a circus full of clowns.",April-15-2018,4
380,"Sad, shocking, and even if it's only 50% true, America continues to lose...Hopefully, this is a wake-up call for everyone. Trump will never change, the lies will never stop, he will never be a good guy.",January-5-2018,5
381,"I found the book to be a confirmation of what I already know about Trump and his entourage for the most part. It's a well-written, articulate narrative detailing how the odyssey began and evolved which was very informative. Michael Wolff is a talented writer. My only criticism is that some of the vocabulary he chose to illustrate his points is a bit too fussy for the general public to easily understand. In other words, you need a dictionary at the ready if you don't have a degree in languages (I do, but sometimes I had to look up certain words) to interpret what is being said. All in all, I enjoyed the book, couldn't put it down being a political junky, and would recommend it as it's a great read and generally supports what is being told to us by the media about the current administration. Fine job, Michael Wolff!",February-15-2018,4
382,"I hate Trump. So as a retired journalist I can say I'm not sure all of the information and scenes in this book are accurate, but I want them to be. As a read, it was delicious.

If you hate prez tweet, you'll love this.",February-21-2018,5
383,"incredible Wolfe was allowed to blend in like a piece of furniture in the White House, tends to suggest too many staffers there do not know what they and others are supposed to be doing, scary when you think of the security of the country (& the Western world).

384,"Definitely a page turner.  I follow the news constantly.  This book is very in tune with what we see and read in the news everday.  I can't say I'm totally convinced it is 100% accurate, but nothing is so outlandish in the book that it is inconceivable.  I would guess it's pretty accurate",January-5-2018,5
385,"I bought this book with considerable skepticism, but Wolff earned my respect. There are a few editing issues early on, understandable given the rush to print, but for the most part it is a page turner that made me laugh deep belly-laughs for the first time since Trump was elected. It is a hilarious book, and every page rings true. Even if he gets a few facts wrong, you simply cannot make up what is in this book - its essence seems true. What I liked best is Wolff's extraordinary insights, page after page, into Trump's character. I admire the way he describes what makes Trump tick from so many angles, with a few vivid, powerful words. I even had to look up a few of those words! But most of all, Wolff enables us to digest just how awful the situation is without adding to our discouragement and sorrow. After a year of fear and trembling, with no end in sight, I am deeply grateful for this small intermission by Wolff. Plus it took courage to publish this book. I am sure Wolff has received death threats, and he has a family to worry about. I honor him for this amazing expose. I think it will become a classic - assigned reading to highschool students in years to come, like Catcher in the Rye.",February-13-2018,5

The chaotic atmosphere is borne out by current headlines. He is probably three-quarters on target. Other reporters and writers have slammed Wolff because they simply do not like him or the way he puts his stories together. The late Hunter S. Thompson had the same problem.  I do not think Trump would have been elected had my fictional Universal Vote System been in place, but you will have to read my novel to find out about it.

390,"People may quibble about this or that minor factual error, but I give Wolff credit for infiltrating this den of vipers, gaining their confidence and then exposing their mendacity and incompetence to the world. Everything he's telling us we already knew, and that's how we know it's basically all true. But he put it in a form that people could relate to, and that helped spark a lot of conversations. So hats off to him for sticking it to these corrupt, lying gangster goons and not pulling any punches. May we yet witness the downfall of this greedy, hypocritical, illegitimate authoritarian regime.",February-19-2018,5

So many competing agendas and so much back-stabbing. Competent administrators head for the door while unqualified relatives, sycophants, billionaires, and white supremacists remain. Will our government survive 4 years of incompetence, impulsiveness, and intentional de-construction? That is the question I am left with. The book at times seems to have been rushed to print, with occasional typos. But overall it paints a picture of the Trump White House that should frighten every American.",March-10-2018,4

401,"The book presents some interesting vignettes that seem to be written more for the gossip than the general reader.  If there had been any secrets, they already had been shared in marketing the book. The writer's style was somewhat irritating.  Wolff is having a love affair with commas and sentence structure often, for me, becomes rather unwieldy. Overall though, the book provides a general and interesting map of events.

408,"Never Have I Seen Such a Reckless Display of Stupidity and Distrust in the American WayI'm reading Fire and Fury today.  Never have I seen such a reckless display of stupidity and distrust in the American way.  Our forefathers tried to protect us from this.  Will we ever crawl out of this political abyss?  The White House is filled with arrogant kooks.  The undoing of our system gives me the spooks.  Disregard for freedom of speech and the press, bullies abound and are making a mess. Trump and his crowd like to call names, they sneer and they mock; they like to play games.  They never intended to win the election, unprepared, they hoped for a major rejection.  Melania cried big crocodile tears, Donald's win conjured up all of her fears.But into the White House the Trumpsters strode full of themselves and the big orange toad.  Donald himself pumped and proud had to toot his own horn and toot it loud.  Making up crowd sizes that didn't exist, spewing ""alternative facts"", Donald couldn't resist.  Pictures of crowd size don the West Wing ordered up by an old man that wished he was king.  He cries ""fake news"" but hangs falsified covers of Time, this unclothed emperor has a twisted mind. Like a small child he demands attention; he and his staff busy sowing dissension.  Trump gathered around him the chaos clownseach trying to curry favor and avoid his frowns.  Bannon wrote  his dire inaugural address, no uplifting words, just ones of distress.  Executive orders rolled out left and right and tweetie-pie tweeted by day and by night.  Immigration reform by presidential order, Bannon and Trump aimed to build a wall on our border.  Jared was working to erase the Mexican mess, but Trump's insults to Mexico laid that to rest.  His children, Bannon, Priebus and the gang, brownnosers all, his praises they sang; each hoping to influence the big orange baboon.  But Trump being Trump is the only man in the room.  He listens to no one, he follows his gut.  He's a blowhard, a show boater and a bone fide nut.And then of course there's the Russian connection.  Putin and friends messed with our election.  Trump and National Security Advisor, General Flynn wanted to thank Russia for Trump's big win.  Lifting sanctions on Russia was Kislyak's pitch.  Flynn was anxious to please and to make himself rich.  General Michael Flynn sold out as many do, money more important than the red, white and blue.  All this Russian colllusion stinks!Too many connections or so me thinks.  Even Bannon accuses Junior of treaspm, but recently Steve walks it back with no reason except to regain favor with Trump the king because Bannon gambled and lost everything.Mueller is following the money and has a tight lip while Trump's White House is leaky and he shoots from the hip. He rambles on and on and repeats himself, so enept and incompetent, he belongs on the shelf.  The man can't pay attention, he doesn't read.  The great negotiator can't even lead.So Fire and Fury is a best seller, but author, Michael Wolff's reputation's not stellar.  He's one of them, that's why he was invited in.  Surely, Trump didn't expect this terrible spin.  So the complete truth is still unknown, but the dysfunction is there and clearly shown.  So, it's up to you to read it or not; many discussable issues and food for thought.",January-10-2018,4

410,"As with so many others, very little in this book comes as a surprise to me. The â€œpeak behind the curtainâ€ù reveals exactly what so many of us fearedâ€”the degree of Trumpâ€™s ignorance and incompetence is staggering. I can only hope every Republican in office who is supporting this insanity will pay the price; within six years there should not be one single Trump supporter left in office anywhere.For pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord alone, the man deserves to spend the rest of his horrible, ugly, life rotting away in a prison cell. I can think of no greater crime against humanity.And, Trump (I know it is hard for you to read, but do your best to work your way through thisâ€”take your time with the multi-syllable words), if you think for one nanosecond you get to tell me, an American citizen, which books I can and cannot read . . . you, sir, are sadly mistaken! I hope this becomes the biggest bestseller of all time!",January-6-2018,5

The contents should not really surprise anyone who had been paying attention, but seeing all of this in writing is positively horrifying. The book reads like a palace intrigue novel about Tsar Nicholas and Rasputin. As such, it would be highly entertaining. As a piece on current history, it is a clarion call to do everything possible to reduce the damage and restore sanity to our government.",January-8-2018,5
412,"I bought the book even though I have no intention of reading it (I can't stomach that much concentrated Trump), but because anyone that Trump is trying so desperately to silence deserves my financial support.",January-6-2018,5
413,"The book was very informative as to the actors' various roles during the Trump campaign and after Trump was elected President.  The book solidifies what most people already suspected - that there is no structure and order, but a faÃ§ade full of bullying, backstabbing, vengeance, and a President who behaves like a five-year old child.",March-18-2018,5
414,"This book reads as an honest and insightful account of the Trump presidency, taking the reader on a journey through each of the people who have leadership roles, and the experiences that lead them up to this point, and what they did when they got into office.  For all the buzz about it, I thought it would be a lot more sensational and filled with hyperbole, but in a lot of ways it is very down to earth.  Rather than showing Trump as an evil plotter and conniver, we get the picture of a very broken and angry soul who's way out of his depth, and the opportunists around his just trying to figure things out.  There are few redeeming characteristics of anyone involved, but there are also no super villains.  It seems comfortingly honest, allowing you to picture real people with no place in politics taking over the white house rather than some Machiavellian villains.  This is the crazy rich uncle and his yes men fumbling their way into the highest place of power in the nation, and the ultra rich backers who keep them in power to do their will.",January-7-2018,5

417,"I am very happy with this book.  I bought it because - well - I *had* to buy it.  I would have been satisfied with the purchase, even if I'd turned around and put it in a goodwill bin.  However, I decided to listen to it, and was pleasantly surprised.  It is articulate and well written.  And despite reports to the contrary, I did not find it to be one-sided or even left-leaning.  It was fascinating and truly enjoyable.  The only down side is how depressed I was at the end, knowing what a truly terrifying world we are now living in (although I knew this well before reading this book, and was already depressed with our current Presidential situation).  As far as if it is accurate or not, it seems very well researched.  And if only 25% of it is actually true, we should ALL be terrified.",February-19-2018,5
418,"I had to wait quite a while.  But, since it is the biggest selling book in the world right now, that is understandable.  I got it. The recording and CDs are perfect.

419,"OMG..... this is so well written.  Honestly I can hardly put it down.  I am surprised that it is not a complete downer.  Wolff is a smart, smart writer.  Wry, tongue-in-cheek, and simply honest, as far as I can tell.  He simply has been in the right place at the right time, and no one told him to leave because no one is really in charge.

422,"Since this book caused such a sensation and was the topic of many news panel discussions, I thought I'd give it a try.  I expected a fast-paced read with all kinds of inside information in to the present administration and leader, I found it a bit boring and hard to get through.  It also came to mind just how accurate the information is.  Not that I'm a fan of Trump, far from it, but if I read something like Fire and Fury, I like to know that it is accurate and with this book, I'm not sure.  I give this one up to more sensationalism than anything else.",February-23-2018,3

425,"Seriously undecided on the worth (or entertainment value, for that matter) of this book.  It started out pretty well, got my attention and I was enjoying it---then hit the 25% mark and the thing became almost in-readable, and somewhat unbelievable, as well.  I put it aside for the better part of a month, taking small stabs at it, but unable to stay with it for long.  Then....got to the 60% point and it picked right up, got readable, (and more believable) and I finished it the following day.The content is iffy, by definition, and really has no solid back-up except what you read in the news, which to me is less than viable much of the time.I can't really make a recommendation about reading the book, either way.I know this review will not be much help to anyone trying to decide whether or not to read it, but I just can't do any better for you.

430,Fascinating book about political corruption. The information in this book only confirms what citizens of these United States learned during the campaign and the necessity to be politically involved.

431,"03/06/2018.  After a long delay, Fire & Fury in paperback arrived in good condition.  It was worth the wait.  Michael Wolff described and analyzed a Donald Trump White House in unflattering conditions.  Basically, three internal factions competed against each other for ascendancy and the ear of  a ""semi-literate,"" TV-addicted, impatient, and self-glorifying president who began with scant knowledge and no experience of  how ""to govern"" in a democracy.  In essence, Fire and Fury is a well-written political and psychological study that reveals an ominous lesson on the deterioration of basic values of fairness and ethics.",March-6-2018,5
432,"Like most of the country, I have followed our increasingly bizarre political climate with fascination tinged with horror.  Wolff can't exactly make all clear (this is, after all,chaos), but he comes as close as perhaps anyone can.  And he tells one devil of a story.  I wonder what will happen next.",January-22-2018,4
433,Seriously everything in this well written book reads like today's continuing saga of the Trump era. I had paused in my reading of this extremely interesting; you are there tale.

442,"Given the insightful information from Steve Bannon and others, this book is a true testament to how Donald Trump is in person.You can trust the words of Steve Bannon as he has not pictured himself in the greatest light to Michael Wolff. This by far is the best book as to how Trump operates and the chaos that resides within the White House. I saw this first hand myself when I visited D.C. a few months ago. Trump had blocked off the entire street of Pennsylvania Avenue because he was paranoid protestors would run down the gate. It was raining and there was no one out there except police and secret services. Talk about paranoia.Side note: I am no fan of Steve Bannon either.",January-10-2018,5

444,"This book offers a view of the Trump White House from the inside.  Beginning with Trump's campaign tactics to his election and his first 10 months in office, the book chronicles the players who moved in and out of the West Wing.  Seemingly, every one of them crafted policies than fluctuated wildly at the whim of the president.  He is portrayed as a self-centered, volatile toddler who refuses to read, listen and comprehend the issues and he has surrounded himself with individuals as self-serving as he is to do his biding.  He constantly ""looks over his shoulder"" in fear of exposure of his business dealings and accusations about Russia.  All of the players are angling for his attention.  Some of the more dangerous ones to our democracy have his ear.",January-23-2018,5
445,"This book nails it!  Yes, there are a few inconsistencies but they are all minor and do not impact the ultimate narrative.  Wolff isn't attempting to lead the reader.  He's presenting the facts and letting the reader draw their own conclusions.  Great explanation/description of the players, their past and what they bring to the White House.  This is a great read and like most reviewers have stated is hard to put down.",January-11-2018,5
446,"The book was exactly as advertised. Basically, two different factions in the white house, leaking all over the place, and telling their side of the story to this reporter.

448,"This is an intriguing book about the mess we currently find ourselves in, and how in the world something so unfathomable could have happened to our country. The most prominent take-away for me was the often-speculated theory that this bid for the presidency was never intended to be a serious endeavor, (one wonders how it possibly could have been, all things considered, frankly), but was, instead, designed to make some sketchy, ill-defined point, and to ""build his brand"", which is partly why his wife supposedly refuses to live in the White House. The speculation has been that she considers the White House too old and shabby, not grand enough, with this book underscoring the point that she never signed up for the duties of being a political wife in general, first lady in particular, have any aspirations towards that end, nor does she have any interest in or enthusiasm for the position. More specifically, neither did he.  Apparently, according to this book, it was his plan to lose and then create this huge display of divisiveness, loud criticism, and back-seat driving, much like he tried to do during the Obama administration, coupled with a big, distracting, posturing, loud, chest thumping, blustering show of demanding a baseless ""crooked Killery"" vote recount due to baseless accusations against her team of voter fraud, which he was, according to this book, already positioning himself to do until he, contrary to his plan, accidentally won, which he apparently had no genuine interest in doing. Reflecting upon his campaign, including the debates, it seems plausible that he committed many acts of self-sabotage towards that end. It never really occurred to me that the wounds were intentional, although there was never any doubt that they were self-inflicted. This book holds many interesting theories that make about as much sense as anything else these days.",March-8-2018,5

Shows trump doesn't know what he is doing, and that those around him are all in it for as much cash as they can stuff into their pockets. Whew! The incompetence and greed of the surprised president glares out from this account written by someone who was quietly watching the entire fall of our sane government from right inside The White House.

Itâ€™s everything the author claimed it is: a fly on the wall inside the Trump White House from before the election through the inauguration.

463,"Michael Wolff has written a thoroughly entertaining book about the train wreck that is the Trump White House. He has a gift for capturing the feel and context of the people we have been watching with a mix of horror and shock over the past year. So far everything rings absolutely true, and itâ€™s a nice narrative reminder that we have a constitutional crisis on our hands.",January-6-2018,5

465,"Yep. Trump's ""administration"" is described exactly as I guessed it to be, but it was an enjoyable if painful read.

I'm just the messenger.",February-20-2018,5

I pre-ordered it when trump was trying to keep it from being published.If you love trump, you probably aren't capable of reading this book anyway.That and it doesn't have pictures.",February-6-2018,5
467,"Michael Wolff has performed a public service with the publication of FIRE AND FURY.  The book highlights the various cliques in year one of the administration as they viciously undermine each other in their attempts to command Trump's paltry attention span.If someone wants to understand the absurd and bizarre operations of Trump's White House, one need not look any further than this well-written book.  It also brings to light the vast extent of Trump's mental illness.That Michael Wolff manages to paint the picture with some humor is a credit to his writing skills.  After all, there's nothing inherently funny about Donald Trump occupying the Presidency.  In any way you could mention, he's unfit for the job, as the book clearly demonstrates.People paying attention at the time to the 2016 campaign could tell Trump never really wanted to be elected in the first place.  He only wanted to up his Brand to smooth the start-up of his own TV Network.  Steve Bannon was the only one with ambitions to work in the White House.",January-21-2018,5
468,"I've been using the ""cold open"" method of reading this book (where you just open up the book anywhere and read a few paragraphs) in an effort to prevent overload.  Certainly no literary masterpiece and Mr. Wolff is likely hyperbolizing for dramatic effect, but neither do I think he is manufacturing out of whole cloth.  Make drinking game out of it, have fun with it, but I wouldn't bet money on flawless accuracy is all I'm saying.  Nevertheless, I will never regret buying this book and helping to make the statement that it did.",February-5-2018,5

Great insight into the key players who are within Trump's  inner circle, including his own family members.  It begs the question, ""How long will this go on?""  And maybe more importantly, ""How much longer will the American people tolerate this behavior?""  It speaks to the tenuous stability of the very core of American democracy, and whether it will survive.  The fact that there is a core base of supporters who staunchly stand by an egomaniac who spins his own galaxy of questionable truth-benders around his version of reality is very upsetting to those looking on.  Where will it all end?  This book begs for more chapters, or a Volume 2 in the continuing saga of Donald Trump.",March-18-2018,5
470,"A very interesting story of our current president's first months in office.  Pretty scary stuff,  if even some of it is accurate, and given the author's access to many of the staff, including Steve Bannon, I have no reason to believe it is untrue.  I gave it four stars, in that I thought the author's vocabulary was a bit stilted (thank goodness that my Kindle provided definitions to some of the terminology used).  I would have preferred to have had a hard copy of the book, but it was not available for several weeks, so I went with the Kindle-version.  All in all, an interesting read...the stuff of which nightmares are made!",March-15-2018,4

472,"Fascinating account of the narcissistic fantasist who was put into office by America's enemies in order to create the maximum chaos and discord in order to divide and damage the country. It reads like the plot of a John Le Carre novel. Unfortunately it's all true. There are still those who find it hard to believe that Americans elected a con artist with a long criminal record who is still being investigated for fraud. The answer, of course, is that they didn't. Although we now know exactly how the Russians took over Facebook, who they were, and how they manipulated these fake identities to target certain focus groups, it is still interesting, however frightening, to read about how well they have succeeded. The author seems unsure whether America will ever recover. The first step should be to encourage as many people as possible to read this book, and face the truth. As they say "" The only way for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing""",March-9-2018,5
473,"Without addressing the hyper-principled questions about Wolff's veracity, his account is not only consistent with what has been reported in other sources (even since the book came out), but also mostly sober, even as he reports real-life farce.

474,"Fascinating and insightful look behind the scenes of this administration!  I thoroughly enjoyed the telling of the chaos that led to the election of this president and the chaos that has ensued since then.  In some respects, it clarified much of what I already suspected and yet still gave me more information on this man and how he has entered the political scene.  I would like to re-read it as it was informative and while some may say it was filled with gossip, I think much of it will prove to be true and justified.",March-8-2018,5

480,"I bought Fire and Fury on Audible and I just can't stop listening. This is the gateway drug for anyone who doesn't read books about politics. It's a fascinating retelling of the first year of the Trump White House from inside the White House, and a terrifying glimpse at the daily clown show that exists at the center of power. The emperor has no clothes, no sense, no patience, no moral center, no compassion. Most terrifying of all, the emperor has no clue. The book lays to rest any assurances one may have had that the president's glaring intellectual void would be mitigated by more sensible minds around him. In a White House built on nepotism, where sons and a daughter whose intellectual capacities are as limited as their father's hold sway, ignorance rules the day.The most interesting thing about this book is that so many people spoke to Wolff on the record, and no one seemed to mind his ubiquitous presence in the West Wing as he watched, listened, and recorded the infighting, and, entertainingly, the war between the Bannon camp and the Ivanka/Jared camp. The complete lack of experience, understanding, and anything resembling intellectual rigor among Trump and those closest to him (most notably his daughter and son-in-law) turned Trump's first year into the most profound, public, unmitigated disaster of any presidency in memory.

The author has been accused of lying however his access to the White House, discussions with many individuals (including Trump), and recordings of many conversations have been verified.Although most of the shocking facts have been discussed on news programs for days already, I bought this book because of the presidentâ€™s attempt to silence our free press, including trying to stop this book.

484,"You have to read between the lines of FAF but it keeps you interested. Wolff shows personal bias against the administration. However he weaves together the web of interactions between the people that influence (or incense) the president from the early days of his administration through the hiring of John Kelly as Chief of Staff and ouster of Steve Bannon. It comes across as generally believable and connects dots better than the limited story-lines unfortunately over recycled by the media--even the media coverage of the book (both positive and negative) glosses over the narrative in favor of click bait inflammatory quotes that fit in a Twitter post. It reiterates that the ongoing conservative v liberal media battle, instigated by POTUS, is a distraction from serious issues to consider regarding leadership, influence, and the important issues of governing.

So many of the news media, ""important"" people got theirs via Amazon, they said so. I guess us little people don't count as much with Amazon.As for the book, it's terribly wordy (like the author).

While my own biases were catered too, there's not exactly standing proof that this is CORRECT. And if you can't back up your stories then you're basically rumors and speculation.There was nothing new or shocking, anyone paying attention can see trump is a malignant narcissist with huge issues on lying, cheating, and being a media fool, get caught?? tell more lies, throw out more smoke and mirrors and baffle everyone with your buffoonery.The book will not be liked by any trump fan, don't bother, you're just going to be angry.

Having seen the author interviewed since the release I can see that he speaks as he writes, using many more words, obscure word choices as well, than could possibly be necessary. There are many spelling and grammar errors in the book as well, perhaps due to the rush to print. In the end though I found it a well constructed recounting of the first 9 months of the Presidency and have begun to see Trump 's various recent actions with a greater understanding.

I notice that I want to catch all of the stop lights on my way to wherever i am going so I can hear more of the book.  The  book is brilliantly written,  with huge psychological insight into what we all see in what is going on with  Donald Trump and the group around him.  I am incredulous as to the criticisms of the book.  I consider this  a great and historic book.

The author has courage and certainly is not shy. It is an important read some of which you may feel is accurate but never skewed or attempted sensationalism.There is no nitpicking or any filler portions just hard hitting observations and reactions. It would be nice if the story took place on a very small island. Perhaps with just the president and family .Make the island great again!,March-28-2018,5

Just like an oncoming train wreck that you can't take your eyes off of, I couldn't stop reading this book.  It's a troubling tale of deceit, complicity, incompetency and mental illness.  It would make a good novel if it weren't the nightmare our nation is living through right now.

519,"It was fascinating to read about the Trump campaign and now White House from the perspective of those in and around the daily - can we say workings?? - of the government. I really do love the spin of this book, because the cast of characters are every bit as dizzying as the Administration. I still remember 45 looking absolutely sick to his stomach on Inauguration Day and thinking, ""holy cow...he wasn't expecting to get elected!"" Just hope he is out before too much damage can be done.",February-5-2018,4
520,There are some new and startling things in this book that you may not have heard before even if you had been following the news closely over the past couple of years.  Even if you had watched a couple of documentaries about Donald Trump and his advisors such as Roger Stone there are still new and disturbing things to learn in Michael Wolff's book.Reading this book is like driving by a car accident.  You feel a sense of dread and you don't want to look but can't help yourself and steal a glance and then feel an awful heaviness in the pit of your stomach and wish you hadn't looked.  The more I read this book the more disturbed I felt and the greater the sense of dread I felt for the country but I couldn't put the book down.The book is well written and did hold my interest and I finished the book in a couple of days.  I intend of re-reading the book again which I guess is a vote of confidence for the author.

The book is distressing if you love your country but well worth reading.,March-12-2018,5

But I, too, feel that $15 is a small price to pay to add my voice to all the others who abhor the notion that Trump is trying to suppress the book's publication, just as he feels justified in attempting to shut down or shut up any views contrary to his own.",January-5-2018,5

529,Interesting observations of what is happening in the White House. I'm wondering why they allowed him access to the information he is reporting.

534,"This book was not quite up to the hype.  Anyone who has closely followed the negative news on the administration will be familiar with the major episodes retold.  What this book includes is insight and ""fill in"" on those episodes, along with the author's analysis.  Don't expect a lot of major quotes from a spectrum of participants.  The main ones come from two or three people, but those people are close to the center of the administration.  The analysis is prosy (repeated use of certain words and phrases you don't hear in regular conversation, ie ""bete noire""), and somewhat repetitive (semi-psychological analysis of the President's motives and mindset).  It's quite possible to cut this book down a bit, and hit the point.It definitely doesn't read like a Bob Woodward book.  More like an old ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty"" episode (I use those examples as I have never watched West Wing or equivalent dramas).  It is drama, and farcical.If half of what is in this book is true, it's worse than I imagined.I give it four stars for the content plus the writing style, both of which are engaging.",January-19-2018,4

537,"To know that we have an incompetent child-like figure for a president is frightening, and Mr. Wolff's carefully researched book clearly demonstrates that inescapable fact.  I bought the audible version, which added an element of reality to the work, and rendered it impossible to stop listening.  This 10-hour ""listen"" is not one you will soon forget.  As one is neither a liberal or conservative I came away convinced that this man needs to be removed from office as soon as possible.  I highly recommend it.",January-10-2018,5
538,"This was a riveting read as well as educational.Firstly, the description of events witnessed behind the scene helps to explain the absolute disjointed mess that is front & center of our daily news cycle.Secondly, I always thought I had an above average grasp of the english language but Mr. Wolff has shaken this belief. I have my trusty notepad with all the unkown words as new vocabulary treasures!I highly recommend this book. It is frightening to imagine our country is being run by such psychologically impaired individuals, full of hubris, narcissism, impulsiveness, grandiosity & , paranoia.",April-14-2018,5

Even if nothing in it is true, there is also nothing in it that is the slightest bit implausible or inconsistent with the facts or Trump's very public and by now familiar incompetence, buffoonery, and spoiled-child behavior or similar behavior by the ignorant and politically inexperienced members of the First Family. Just the fact that the book is a number one Amazon seller and is obviously pissing Trump off makes it well worth buying and reading!",January-13-2018,5

The overall picture, although not necessarily all the details,  is consistent with what has previously been reported. As an ordinary citizen, I am concerned having a President who repeatedly tells falsehoods to the people (Politifact reports 70% of his statements range from Mostly False to Pants on Fire lies) allegedly does not read (especially intelligence briefings dealing with national security), is apparently receptive only to those who flatter him and tells him what he wants to hear (no matter what the truth may be), and whose main concern seems to be showing a macho image to his base, which serves to divide and not unify this country.

No one expected him to win.  Just to make a statement.  Kind of sad.",January-6-2018,4

I'm sure there are some statements of both flavors. It's just seriously depressing that we've devolved to this position as a nation. And frankly it disappoints me even more that a purported resolution of the factuality of any given statement would probably not change anyone's opinion of how they voted.  Either way.  When facts don't matter, we are in a very bad position as a country.",March-11-2018,4
549,Fascinating and disturbing at what goes on in Washington as people fight for personal gain and satisfaction at the expense of millions of people who are affected by their actions and decisions.

Yes Trump was fighting with Melania on inauguration day! He seemed pissed at her and he was! That's just one of the many confirmations in this book. It's salacious, and so much of it rings true. Wolff acted as a quasi therapist to all the back stabbing minions of the Trump White House, yet Wolff was a wolf in sheep's clothing to them. He acted as a mole really. However you feel about Michael Wolff's tactics, he came up with a tell all that exposes something very close the truth, which is no small task given the nest of liars he had to contend with. The fact that they let this man in the White House is proof of the massive incompetence of the Trump administration that is so aptly and believably described in this book.",January-11-2018,5
552,"I am so grateful I read this book in my Kindle. I used the dictionary on almost every page. Time I will never get back. The content is what gave this 4 stars.

There's no telling what kind of trouble this megalomaniac will get us into.  I think everyone who voted for him should lose their voting rights.  Oh, I'm supposed to be rating the book.  Sorry.  If you already suspect Trump is a buffoon this book will confirm it and it will provide the facts to support it. You'll say to yourself ""I knew it!"" And, you'll obnoxiously quote it to your friends.  Good.  That's about all you can do, now.  It's a great read,  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Couldn't put it down.  Thank you Michael Wolff.",March-8-2018,5

558,"Thank Goodness Bannon was sent down the road.  Although Trump brought him in, can you imagine how much worse this country would be if Trump had sat back and let Bannon carry out the agenda he and others had set for America (reference the prologue.)  Bannon is a dangerous man who needs to get over it; we are not going back to the 50's.  This country has progressed too damn far to think Americans will sit idly by and let that BS happen. A country is supposed to move forward, and progress, not stagnate and regress. Thank goodness our president had the presence of mind to be petty, jealous and self-absorbed. Bannon was getting too much press, too much credit and that's a no no for The Donald.  You don't upstage The Donald.  Bless Bannon's heart with his cockiness and hubris in thinking he could control or even ""work around"" The Donald.  He truly underestimated the president.  By the time he had gone a few rounds with the president, Donald had the man more disheveled than usual, haggard, losing weight, waiting around like an eager puppy, trying to get the last word in for the night (as, according to Wolff, ""the last person Trump spoke to ended up with enormous influence."")  Only he had to hope he could get to him before Jarvanka, Priebus or McDonald's.I am glad I read the book if only to get an idea of what someone dangerous like demagogue Bannon would do if opportunity and history met at a pinnacle moment.  I thank Wolff for being there to reveal it; and I thank The Donald for eventually thwarting it ... bigly!  It is the only good thing I have seen come out of this administration.

560,"All in all, a great book! There is simply nothing in this account that CAN be a lie -- most of it's events were on the pages of the Washington Post over the past year if you actually paid attention -- Wolff's taped interviews with Trump's aides are only adding some gossipy name calling and black humor to the mix. But this does help the causal reader reconcile why Trump's administration has been so disordered, senile, ADHD and ineffective -- that's the real Trump shining through.

Our nation deserves so much better than this and it's up to us to correct this awful mistake. Michael Wolff tells it like it is.  It would be hard to find  someone less suited to the office than Trump.  Do we need any other reminder that every vote counts?",February-23-2018,5
566,"In all my 81 years, I would never have believed that this beloved country of mine could have been controlled by such chaos!

568,"Finished the book and it provided a pretty good description of the time mostly after the 2016 election. The narrative is pretty clean considering the amount of backstabbing that occurs. Not much of a surprise, but the detail gives a better insight into Trump and those around him. The only problem is the cutoff when most know there is more dysfunctional behavior that happened and more coming in the future. This book could be a series although Wolff probably won't get another White House invitation.",January-15-2018,5
569,"Fire and Fury demonstrates that a great writer can completely disappear into the narrative whilst observing the drama first hand. And what a drama it is.Let's just put aside the fact that this POTUS and administration might damage the world beyond our recognition, and focus on the dysfunctional man at the top: by giving their president so much power they have hobbled their own prosperity across the board. A fascinating read.",January-13-2018,5
570,"I bought this book not to read but to support the courage of the author, Michaela Wolff, for writing it. I got through the first chapter. It's well written, but the subject of the book, Chump, is so disgusting I couldn't read anymore without throwing up. So, I donated it to the library. I'm glad I bought it and supported Mr. Wolff, and would do so again. Perhaps its success will encourage other journalists to be as brave and shed light on the Nightmare on Pennsylvania Avenue.",March-1-2018,5

572,"The face, the conscience, the intellect, the soul, the heart and the leader of the Republican Party.A very interesting read.For those who follow this stuff, it fills in some holes, and gives some depth to the never ending stream of press coverage. The overwhelming thought I had running through this was for all of the folk that put their trust in trump because he was â€œa successful businessmanâ€ù. He even said â€œI only hire the best people.â€ù This is who they gotâ€_the cast of characters is amazingâ€_.Bannon, Stephen Miller, Ivanka, Kushner, Preibus, Scaramucci, Pence, Cohn, Kellyanne, Flynn, Manafort, Hope Hicks, Don Jr., Eric, Sessions, Wilbur Ross, Pruitt, Spicer (Spicey), Mnuchin, Omarosa, Lewandowski, and that ever lovable character, Sebastian Gorka.The other thought was for those that wanted to throw a Molotov cocktail into the system. I hope they are enjoying the fire.",January-13-2018,4
573,"As an observer,the author gives a close look at the ""reality  MindPresident Trump.""And what Mr Wolff revels is a White House chaotic, out of control, power struggle staff who wants to curry favor with the Donald.I recommend this book for those who want to keep our Democracy..People who have an Open  Mind",February-10-2018,4
574,This is scary stuff.  Hope we can make it until the end of this mistake of a Presidency.  Wish it was fiction.,January-6-2018,5
575,"Excellent book.  Highly entertaining and extremely interesting.  It doesn't seem like the author exaggerates much, if at all, while documenting Trumps well known faults, foibles, and 'eccentricities'.  Trump really is quite a piece of work.",January-8-2018,5
576,"Mostly a reiteration of news we already knew, but put together in a comprehensive timeline. The Bannon stuff is frightening. A book I probably wouldnâ€™t have read without the attempt to stop its publication. It does remind us we cannot become complacent regarding this incompetent and dysfunctional administration.",January-6-2018,5
577,"This book kind of came and went.  If you're looking for in-depth analysis, this is not the book for you.  For someone who just wants an overview, along with a little gossip, its somewhat informative, but mainly entertaining.  The author has never made any claims of being an insider.  He has said that just by ""hanging around,"" he picked up on some things and some of them are quite interesting.  This book is certainly not going to win any literary prizes.  By the time I got to the end, I had decided he didn't really know anything more other than what anyone could have picked up by spending all his time on the internet and watching cable news.  I do have to give him credit for more or less making this clear.  I think it is a good primer for someone who wants a glance into the Trump administration.",March-7-2018,3
578,"I generally enjoyed the book, although there were some blatant factual errors. Nothing major, but simple things like what year Speaker Boehner resigned, getting politicians office titles wrong, or altogether naming the wrong person who attended an event (who actually wasn't there). Unfortunately for Mr. Trump, none of these factual inaccuracies change the overall tone and message of the book, which is that the Trump Administration never should have existed.",January-20-2018,4

580,"This book, fact or fiction, is a page turner. It moves like a James Patterson bestseller. This could be read for entertainment alone, and be worth the money and time. You don't need to a political pundit or an armchair analyst to enjoy the intrigue and humor and political backstabbing, that course non-stop through the book.Some say that this book is wildly inaccurate. I hope so, because if this  is even partly true, we could be witnessing the most incompetent administration since Warren G. Harding.I",January-15-2018,4
581,"Loved this book!!! It usually takes me a long time to read a book cause I am always busy and it's hard to read with kids around but I got through this one really quick, about two days. The only negative comment I have is that there are few misspellings and grammar errors throughout the book, who proofread this??? I you are on the fence about getting, just buy it cause you wont regret it, was worth every penny. Really an interesting read.",February-4-2018,5
582,"This book is a must-read that reveals the background behind the headlines we see every day in real time.  Eminently engrossing, I couldn't put it down.  The narrative is so strong it becomes a page-turner all the way.  I had read the book ""Trump Revealed"" by Michael Kranish, and so much of what Kranish described of Trump's business and personal background and lack of ethics is powerfully played out in living color in everything Michael Wolff reports.  Some critics have suggested that parts of Wolff's book are exaggerated or untrue.  I can't speak to that.  But if even 50% of the book is accurate--and I would wager it is far, far more than that--this country is in great peril. The man in today's White House is uncontrollable, unstable, uninformed and in it only for self-enhancement.  Never has the United States, its Constitution, its way of life and its people faced greater danger from its elected leader than it does now from this misguided, corrupt and unqualified man.",March-7-2018,5

585,"The book just reaffirmed what I had already thought about how our current Prez is not even close to being qualified or capable to lead this country. I respect that a large number of people didn't want Clinton, but this guy has proven over and over that he is not capable of working with others to make decisions that benefit the majority of the people in this country. He is only concerned about his own ego and playing nice to his base followers. The book pointed out so many scenarios that support and reinforce my belief as stated above.While interesting, the book left me with a feeling of desparation over the direction that our country is taking. He is in fact not making this country greater, but is actually tearing down many of the cornerstone moral principles that our country was founded on. As Trump would say... such a shame, such a shame, such a shame... as he usually repeats himself at least 3 times in 1 paragraph.",March-7-2018,4
586,"Reading this book has just enforced what I was seeing.  The book is a very good read.  I enjoyed it.  Some people claim itâ€™s not true. Whether fiction or true, I enjoyed reading it and I claim it as true.We must all vote.  We must all vote for people that will support this Nation. Itâ€™s sad to see and hear people say they didnâ€™t vote because they didnâ€™t like the candidates.  You must vote to prevent AMERICA from what we are in now. If you didnâ€™t vote, you canâ€™t complain (in my opinion).As you have seen the president has loyalty only to himself. So, make it your loyalty to yourselves to vote.I suggest everyone (especially if you didnâ€™t vote) to read it and think about it. Is this who you want to represent you and America?This review is my opinion",January-8-2018,5
587,"I confess that listening to this book has resulted in an epiphany for me with regard to Donald Trump; namely, that he is genuinely ""who he is.""  Like a child without guile, it is clear that he is genuinely narcissistic, genuinely out of touch with reality, genuinely convinced that he will be the ""best president ever,"" and so on.  In other words, I have come to realize that he is not evil and conniving, but is just who he is, and VERY proud of it.  It is also interesting to me how much of what is recounted in the book are things we already know -- from what we have all seen and heard from Donald Trump himself.  The author has confirmed this in public interviews, acknowledging his own surprise at how much attention has been generated by the book's release, as if it was full of ""revelations.""  This book provides a wonderful context for understanding the almost daily shocks to our political system and national discussion inspired by the Trump White House.  Of course President Trump makes false and misleading statements almost continuously -- he has always made up his own reality as he went along and will continue to do so indefinitely.  I have not quite finished the read, but everything I have heard so far rings absolutely true.  Regardless of how the Donald Trump presidency turns out, I suspect this work will continue to be read long after President Trump fades into obscurity.",January-10-2018,5

591,"An excellent read.  Nothing really surprising as anyone who has followed trump through the years, knows he is ALL of the things that the people in the White House have called him.  But hopefully those who have not taken the time to research who he is, will finally learn what a danger he is to our democracy. Very well written and a few new insights.  There are no heroes in this tale....just a cast of of truly horrible people.",February-11-2018,5

593,"Clearly biased but it's hard to argue the facts. I'm fairly neutral in my political stance (I've read Fire & Fury, In Trump We Trust, ect...) and I found this book entertaining, funny, disturbing and thought invoking, all of which make a great read. I definitely recommend this book!",March-12-2018,5
594,"Should be read by all Americans, especially those who voted for Donald Trump.  Maybe not all of the facts are exact but the characters take on a life not available through news sources.  The great dismay I feel is because Trump is so poorly informed about how the world works, about how we exist as parts of complex systems maintained through nonlinear dynamics with different scales in time and space with possibilities of multiple causalities.  He doesn't have a clue.  The reader will realize quickly what danger we are in as a people and nation.",March-28-2018,5
595,Since I am somewhat of a news watcher I knew of the friction in the Trump White House. This book gives a real insiders view. Astonishing ineptitude on Pennsylvania Avenue lead by giving Michael Wolff to roam the halls at will. A must read for anyone who cares about America.,January-15-2018,4

598,"With all the hubbub about this book, I found it OK...just OK. I got the feeling that Michael Wolff spend most of the time trying to impress the reader with how many big words HE knows. We know Trump has big words ( sic ) but Wolff went overboard. It's not that they were out of place, but he could have turned it down a bit and the book would have flowed better and would have made it interesting instead of work.He got his point across that the White House is in disarray and the right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing. A true zoo. Would I recommend it ? Neutral on that. I'm definitely not a Trump supporter, but this really didn't tell me anymore I didn't already know.",March-16-2018,3

601,"If you are interested in politics especially our current president, if you must call him that , then you will enjoy this book. It validates all the fears and embarrassments  I have  about him. How half the country voted him in I will never understand. But this book has interesting tid bits about life inside Trumpâ€™s White House and the way he manages issues or doesnâ€™t manage them. An interesting look about the senior staff as well.",January-20-2018,4

603,Even if you don't plan on reading this book it's worth the $15 to show Americans will not stand for censorship. I'm not sure I have the strength to endure much more of Trump and all things that come along with him but I also feel a sense of duty to support something he's so adamantly against.,January-5-2018,5

If you have the gut feeling that this presidency is a crazy, unhinged amateur production of The Producers, this is your script. It's unsettling, to say the least, and impossible to look away from much like a bad accident. You know you shouldn't look but you do. It's as informative as it is scary.",January-7-2018,5

611,"I Hate Trump, with a passion!!! Hence I LOVE this book.  That being said, the book does have some loose factual reporting in it, and much of it is a synopsis of things that were reported over the course of what one might describe as a horrendous abortion of the first year of president (I use that term loosely here) Trump.  However, there is some interesting reporting and on-the-record quotes from major players inside the white house which paints a picture of an amateur circus that is the administration and their policy making/decisions.  If nothing else, it gets under the thin-skinned president and I'm all for advancing that cause.",January-19-2018,5

614,"I agree that the book is a rambling narrative about the first few months of the Trump Administration. However, lets put this into perspective: there has never been, nor will there ever be a President quite like DJT. Therefore how can a book that was nearly banned from publication live up to the expectations of a polished novel or political account of any of the past presidencies? When the curtains come down on the Trump Administration, Americans and the rest of the world will wake up with a hangover and have to do a lot of soul searching to remember just how chaotic the Administration was. This book will form part of the national record recording what happened and giving the reader a perspective into a style of governing that is unfit for the twenty-first century.",January-16-2018,5

I'm guessing most one star reviews were by Trump supporters for obvious reasons. This might be enlightening to those people but I would suspect they wouldn't enjoy being enlightened.

639,"I get the feeling that if 10% of this book is accurate, then Trump is the most dangerous man in the world.  But, it seems to be so in accord with the insanity we have all experienced with Trump last year, it is likely 100% accurate.  Goodbye world!",January-29-2018,5
640,"That being said, this book is like candy to me.  It reinforces everything I either suspected, and/ or intuited.  Well crafted, a joy to follow, easily digested.  I am normally not a consumer of non fiction, however in this case, it was easy to cross over. Most non fiction does not paint pictures in my mind, yet here I am extolling the virtues therein.

645,"I was torn on purchasing this book as I felt much of it had been shared on Twitter and discussed on cable news. There were few surprises as I have been following the political pundits on Twitter for several years. However what I did find interesting was who was responsible for the early leaks in the presidency. Overall this was a very good read and very depressing  when you consider what is to come and what Bannon has planned for the future, although he is currently without funding thanks to this book.",January-15-2018,4
646,"I purchased this in audio book format.  If you are looking for a salacious, National Enquirer read.... just tune in to cable news.  (They have to sell advertising...no shame).  This is a succinct account of the election's lead up, and the stunned realization of Trump""s win by his election staff and the likes of Rupert Murdock and Roger Ailes. The collective ""what now"" of those wishing to cash in on the adventure, rather than the spoils being a low-paying job at the White House, is framed with a historic sensibility.  The book is sold-out in a single day.  Must say, those decrying its contents, without availing themselves to reading it, cover-to-cover, add nothing but a jaunticed-eye opinion.... nothing more.",January-6-2018,5

Just one person's observations who got a really close look at the antics in the White House and presented them very believably.

659,"The book is amusing, at times riveting, occasionally shocking and often reads like a poorly edited novel.Clearly, the most primary source of information is Bannon, so this is not objective reporting except maybe about how Bannon perceives the White House. I did not take a lot of what is said by either named or unnamed sources as objective fact. As the author said, he received conflicting accounts about some events and in some cases he chose one over the others. But what this book does establish is that a whole lot of folks in the Trump circus have their own agendas, and that Trump engenders in his staff the same lack of loyalty that he shows to people who do not tongue bathe his ego.It sure seems mostly believable in regard to Trumpâ€™s temperament, ego and work habits, the way he treats people, and his complete lack of interest in or understanding  of public domestic or foreign policy. The thesis that he did not want to be president rings true. I feel like I could have written this book on those themes just by watching the president at work and reading his tweets.But unlike the assumption I formed from hearing about the bookâ€™s  most damning revelations, I donâ€™t think it is entirely a hit piece. One can hate what the administration says and does and how it says and does it. But Trumpâ€™s instincts do align with those who voted for him to burn the house down and build it in an entirely different way. His staff, even those who talk trash to the author as quoted in the book, believe in this mission at least broadly, and are quietly doing so, much more than some of us might have hoped.",January-22-2018,4

661,"Interesting dynamics in the WH. It isnâ€™t solely focused on Trump, in fact, he is isnâ€™t the primary topic in most of the chapters.  It covers his key appointees, their attitudes and motives. None of them get on with each other. They come with their own agenda and essentially get no support from Trump or each other.  As a result, the reader will never get the feeling the country is in good hands. Itâ€™s a good read if you want some idea of what actually goes on in this administration. More than half of the people in the book are gone and more are likely to depart soon, but the overall chemistry of the place isnâ€™t likely to change as long as Trump is still there.",March-15-2018,4

663,"I liked the depth of his reporting and the number of incedents and people he referred to on so many topics.I least liked his use of basic language skills and very unorganized style.  I suppose it reflects the pace of the white house, but I had to reread sections to really get the meaning.  If the language is reflective of those in the,White House then our country needs to invest in serious educational improvement and especially basic English.",March-9-2018,4

672,"While Wolffâ€™s style is quite salacious and aimed at the gossip columns, his narrative goes to great lengths to establish a lens through which to view the Trump presidency. Upon release, Wolffâ€™s own ethics were challenged by conservative media, and even several members of the mainstream media, yet nothing shared here really comes across as a surprise. Trump is an impulsive, foolish blowhard who wants to be loved desperately; this fuels his more Machiavellian instincts and compulsive need to insult everyone who either defies or disagrees with him. Everyone else in his administration is somewhere on the spectrum between total complicity and outright betrayal. The thing Iâ€™m most impressed by is how anyone still works in the West Wing. Itâ€™s perhaps the most toxic work environment in all government.The book is a fine historical inside look into the train wreck of the worst Presidential administration ever. Itâ€™s nothing greater than that, though.",March-8-2018,3

674,"The book was all I expected and more: a vivid and totally believable recount of events that dominated the news last year from the perspective of an insider in the White House. At times the book was a bit repetitive and the style sloppy -perhaps it  was hastily written and edited. However, the book is mesmerizing and engaging and  offers a depressing and vivid portrait of our commander in chief and the White House leadership. Highly recommended.",January-14-2018,4
675,Stick it to der Fuhrer!,January-11-2018,5
676,"Trump tried to prevent the publication of this book for good reason: it documents how unqualified he is to be president. Even if, as the right alleges, half of it is untrue Wolff's description of the chaos in the White House and Trump's own stupidity are utterly damning. And Bannon excels in the combined roles of Rasputin, Svengali, and Goebbels. As 2018 opens one is forced to consider that the American experiment may well be over.Incidentally, I would have given the book five stars had it been subject to the ministrations of a competent editor. It is rife with misspellings and grammatical howlers. There are so many homophone errors that I suspect much of it was dictated to speech recognition software and never reviewed.",January-13-2018,4
677,"Not the best written book ever, but it's a page turner for sure - like a grisly car wreck, where you just can't look away.  Even if only half of what the author claims is true then the president of the United States is a danger to humanity. Seriously. You should read this.",February-23-2018,4
678,"The author confirms what I have observed since he took office. Trump is ill suited for the position of president and commander-in-chief. His behavior is erratic, his plans, which are no more than vague concepts, are poorly thought through. Multiple accounts of a number of people in his administration validate that the White House is in a perpetual state of disorganization, if not outright chaos. The book is a good read, but leaves you wondering how we ended up in this place.",March-7-2018,5
679,This book is both informative and entertaining. One really feels like they are sharing the experience with the author of daily sitting on a couch in the West Wing being fed the in house gossip of the day.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone .,January-21-2018,5

It was funny too and it helped me let go of the tension I had around this time in history, how America has become a weaker nation because of this ridiculous figure and his cohort. But, I get it. This was always a possibility. There are Americans who wanted this to happen. It an education for me.",March-13-2018,5
685,"No smoking guns but definitely portrays the new White House Administration as expected based on rumors and leaks that have already been picked up by the press but still worth the read (or listen).While the White House disputes is validity, most of what Wolf documented seems to be easy to verify since again, if you've been paying attention for the last year, you'd already know most of it to be fairly accurate as most of the book aligns with press reporting on the incidents discussed! (Unless you only watch FOX news). Wolf provides more color and detail on specific incidents that the press could only speculate about.IMO, the book confirms that the White House is in complete chaos mode. This administration had no intention of winning and now has no idea what they are doing, now that they are there. I definitely had more than a few laugh out loud moments that were nothing short of gratifying when hearing the way the people closest to Trump really think of him.I would give it 5 stars but since Wolf himself admitted he had a few minor facts wrong, I would have preferred he been a bit more diligent as to not give any ammunition to this WH for arguing the validity of the book.",January-10-2018,4

688,"My gut reaction is to oppose anything that trump wants so his opposition to this book alone made me want to read it.  I have listened to the audible version twice now. I see it as an interesting but probably gossipy and exaggeration of the truth.I read many biographies and usually I feel after the book that i can understand or relate to the subject better, There does not seem to be one likable or admirable character in the entire book. I still detest trump but unfortunately I donâ€™t understand him a tiny bit better.",January-7-2018,5
689,"If you appreciate good writing, get this book. I have to disagree with some of the other five star reviews here: There is a lot we *havenâ€™t* heard before. Wolff is a fabulous writer who comes up with very original takes, told with aplomb. People can quibble with a few minor details, but the arc of each story line points toward truth, revealed in entertaining and surprising ways. Wolff should also be congratulated for pulling off the access journalism scoop of the century. If humanity is still around in a few hundred years, historians will still be combing through this book. Leave the politics out of it for a moment - Wolff has talent and knows how to use it. If you have a serious problem with this book, then you probably have an axe to grind. I only wish I could write half as well as Wolff does.",January-6-2018,5

693,"For me, there wasnâ€™t much that hasnâ€™t already been reported in the news. In conclusion, if what is written is to be believed, President Trump will either be extracted from the White House in hand cuffs or a straight jacket. Either of those options would work for me.",January-21-2018,4

695,"This book is essentially verification of what we already knew if you are a regular viewer of the news but it is interesting and there are a few insights that clarified some of the craziness weâ€™ve been witnessing for the last year.

Just as an analogy, consider a huge clear plastic ball with a jillion little colored pieces inside:  every time one of the pieces move, the whole corpus spins and whirls, all the pieces ending up in different places.  The book is well written and it is interesting, but since I prefer order over chaos, I found myself bothered quite a bit.  Since I finished the book, nothing has come along to reassure me that in the end, all will be well.Fires (and fury) may burn brightly but what is left is generally ash.",March-18-2018,4
701,"Any book the President of the United States of America threatens to block via lawsuit should be required reading. But that's not why I purchased this (Kindle Edition). HOWEVER - this book should come with some warnings. If you like thinking to yourself ""Don't worry, it'll all be OK,"" don't read this. Nothing changes between when you start reading it and when you put it down, except maybe that flicker of hope that ""surely he'll start acting like a rational President"" is just that much harder to maintain. There is something akin to the feeling of ""Wait - this is not just a bad dream?"" going on in my mind - YMMV (your mileage may vary)..Now - what to believe? The White House - in an amazing clairvoyant feat - has declared this book to be fiction prior to even previewing it. Doubtless, some 25% of the populace will hold to that line of thought and claim it all to be bunk (likely with the same clairvoyance, prior to having read a word). There are conversations detailed in the book that make you think ""That can't be true,"" or ""No one is that [...]."" So you have to read it for yourself, and decide for yourself.Full disclosure - I haven't yet finished it (I'm a fast reader, but not that fast). So maybe in the end I'll find out this too is an eloborate, War-of-the-Worlds type of fiction. I sure hope so.Edited update - I'm at the ~80% mark, so still not finished, but thought I'd share some additional observations. First, it is somewhat surreal to be reading a book published 24 hours ago, while simultaneously reading tweets from the main subject of the book about the book. That's somewhat alternate-reality-ish. Second.... enough excerpts of the book have appeared in the press, the only real question remaining is : ""Is it true?"" Unless absolutely no one in the West Wing or Trump family is capable of keeping quiet about ANYTHING (who knows?), there are some parts of the book that either have been fabricated or are 2nd-or-3rd-hand accounts. For example, in Chapter 15 when Trump's comments re: Lewandowski sent Hope Hicks out of the room, if Trump, 2 sons and Hicks were the only people there, who relayed the story?  HOWEVER - so far I've found it all to be a very plausible explanation for the dysfunction of the past 12 months.Last edit: just some final thoughts after completing the book. The book is obviously heavily Bannon-influenced - most of the first-hand quotes are Bannon's, and it is pretty clear the author had the most access to Bannon. The argument for the book being completely true can be summed up by a famous aphorism known as Hanlon's Razor: ""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.""I'd like to believe it's fiction - I really would. But it lines up so closely with actual facts and events, and offers such a rational explanation for irrational behavior, that I am inclined to believe the bulk of it. And as other reviewers have said, even if only a small percentage of the book is true, we're in serious trouble.",January-5-2018,5

703,"Though it can make for painful reading, this book seems to offer precise and accurate observations of the initial phases of the Trump presidency.  Descriptions of the real-life characters (including Trump himself), their decisions, judgments, personal interactions, and chaotic, disorganized ways of functioning would seem to suggest something of an offensive, sickening surrealism.  Wolff is just reminding us how deeply submerged in the ACTUAL swamp we've been pushed to descend.",March-7-2018,5
704,"Michael Wolffâ€™s perceptive take on the powers, personalities and motivations that shaped the first nine months of Trumpâ€™s administration is a juicy tell-all. He is the Truman Capote of the West Wing. I could not put this book down. If you want a deep dive into the infighting and backstabbing that shaped Trump World in 2017, then this is the book for you. News junkies will have many a-ha moments, as Wolffâ€™s colorful descriptions of the Kushners, Steve Bannon, Reince, et al put events like Charlottesville and Trumpâ€™s relationships with the American oligarchs in a new light. Wolff himself says he has a keen eye for human weakness, which is an understatement. His big picture view of the parties shaping the Trump presidencyâ€™s first year is accurate and devastating. My one regret is that this book had to end at some point. If only Mr. Wolff were still inside the White House, providing us with his clear-eyed pointed takes. He had me inexplicably rooting for Steve Bannon at the end, which is pretty amazing. Loved this book and I recommend it without reservation.",March-7-2018,5

In terms of the writing itself, my copy had a lot of typos (pubic vs. public as an example) and Wolff found it necessary to use really big words that seemed like overkill.  Was that to confuse the President or to impress the reader?  Not sure.  I spent quite a bit of time with a dictionary looking up those words and some don't exist so I dunno.  I'm glad I read it but it isn't a literary gem by no means.",April-12-2018,3

I found that it was not a stretch to believe what it says about what was going on inside the Trump White House as so much evidence of it was out in the open because of the players public behavior and pronouncements.I found it quite humorous at times, even while getting confirmation of the shenanigans, back stabbings, disarray, unpreparedness, incompetence, disgraceful political maneuvers, and such that blew in with this gang of opportunists.Editing flaws are enough to make it obvious that it was published in a rush, hence the 4 stars.

721,This book goes a long way in explaining the paradoxes and seeming craziness of Donald Trump's election and White House behavior.  It seems to be as seen through the irreverent eyes of Steve Bannon.  Yet much of it rings true if a bit biased.  Well worth reading and cleverly and humorously written.

725,"The book reads like a really long tabloid article about Bannon and Bannon's political views and his opinions of the people in the White House. Up until the last chapter, everything in the book could have been written from articles already published. Only in the last chapter does Bannon begin to totally unravel and begin to vomit some of the repulsive actions of the Trump family.",January-21-2018,3

730,"Of course you have to read this.  The reporting from inside the Trump White House during 2017 paints a picture of a chaotic management style run amok.  The willingness of the people working there to openly discuss the situation shows how they accept it as normal, which of itself shows how few of these people have experience with normal.  This will probably be the basis for the movie when it is made.",March-15-2018,4
731,"Not Pulitzer Prize writing, but fascinating storytelling.  While I think Wolff may have gone ""on record""  with some who wanted to remain off the record, little that he has written has been denied by the principals.

While I'm still not a supporter of the President's policies and behavior, I do feel some sympathy for the man.  The poor fool...",January-18-2018,5

741,"It is difficult to decide whether this is a fact based book or a very good fictionalized version of the ongoing presidential term. Much of the tenor confirms the reports and editorials in the mainstream news, but specific quotes cannot be confirmed. I would recommend this book to people who are less concerned with facts but enjoy books of political intrigue.  While titillating, it should be taken with a grain of salt.",January-11-2018,3

744,This is must read book. Although some of it is probably not 100% accurate it is close enough to get a idea of the mess going on in the White House. Makes you remember if some one promises something to good to be true it probably is.,March-1-2018,5

746,Lets face it. On the big picture there is very little new here. We all know that Trump is colossally unfit to be president. I enjoyed learning the details. The only downside of the book is that its a little too focused on Bannon. It would be nice to have a broader perspective.,January-13-2018,4
747,One can't be surprised... that when you associate with snakes you are going to get bitten. Michael Wolff writes an unbelievable story that rings true.,January-19-2018,4

750,"This is one of the most well-written narratives I have ever read. The Harvard vocabulary of Mr. Wolff was more that impressive. To be honest, I sensed that Mr. Wolff was not a ""Trumpkin""; however you can't make all this shit up. It's like l had an idea some bad stuff was going on and Michael invited me to come in and have a seat and make my own decisions. Pretty skillful. Don't critique the book unless you have read it. Whew!!!!!",February-25-2018,5
751,This book is really fun to read.,January-5-2018,5

753,"An interesting look into the chaos and warfare within the Trump White House. Much sounds like a more detailed version of what I'd already read in the Post and NY Times. A bit tabloid-ish. Got bored before the end but persevered. Seems to be as much about Bannon as it is about Trump, perhaps more so. Author clearly thinks the president is unintelligent and unfit for office. Lots of raw language. Advised my friends not to bother with it",January-25-2018,3
754,"I just purchased it to piss off Trump. But it is a depressing tome about the half-wit kook who is currently playing ""president"". It's now upstairs sitting on a shelf by the catbox. The cat kicks litter on it sometimes.",April-13-2018,5
755,"The book was full of surprising stories for the first few chapters, but then it started to drag on!  I found that Wolf uses some of the most uncommon words, to the point that almost every few pages I read a word Iâ€™d never heard of and English language has always been one of my strengths. It seemed almost deliberate, to the point of superiority.  All in all, this book was a disappointment.",February-20-2018,2
756,I had to shake my head at how Trump conned the Trumpettes around the country. The book is very scary at the collection of misfits and malcontents in the White House.,February-5-2018,4

759,"It's not a master work of journalistic writing, nor is it a series of groundbreaking revelations about our president. It's honestly full of run on sentences and gossip, but I didn't get it for anything groundbreaking. What it is, to me, is a symbol of what the Trump presidency has been. If people ask me what it was like when I'm old and this is all behind us I will hand them this book. It can drag on in sections, the whole thing isn't well put together, and generally it can be a confused story of known ineptitude. Sounds like the last year to me.If only the smallest fraction of this book is remotely true, it's only piling on at this point anyway. There's nothing so blatantly far from my day to day observations about how in over their heads they are. I'm just glad I got this book on the one year anniversary and finished it by the end of the shutdown.Besides, Trump tried to hold the publication of this book at bay, so to him I spent $18 to say ""f*** your censorship, you couldn't read this book if you tried anyway"".",January-23-2018,5

761,"Poorly written and even more poorly edited.  I was so excited to get this book I had to get it on kindle not my preference, I usually like a paperback or hardcover.  I did not finish the book I was a little bored because it mainly restated things I already knew from reading and watching the news.  Maybe the 2nd half of the book gets better I donâ€™t know if I get around to it maybe I will finish it.",March-7-2018,2
762,"Once beginning the book there is no putting it down. Most parts of it presented what was public knowledge, but the author enlightens with background behavior and motives in White House actions. In some parts surprising but overall enlightening. Trust is non existent; leakers are from within to jockey for power and Trumpâ€™s favor. All party members should read it regardless whether they love, hate, or could care less about whoâ€™s president. The book portrays a WH in which confusion could be calculated to maintain power and leave us all with the feeling of worry about our countryâ€™s future.",March-19-2018,5

766,"politics aside - not well written, as the narrative jumps all over the place and at times, just seems like gossip.  that said, if 1/3 of what was written is true - we, as a nation, are in deep trouble with this leadership.  started out ""ok"" but around middle of book, I started to gloss over sections that didn't keep my interest.  it was hard to finish this read - but I did.",March-11-2018,2
767,"Like many other reviewers, I bought this book, not because I am anxious to read it, but because Donald Trump tried to prevent its publication and thereby to make it impossible for me to read it. This sort of ""prior restraint"" by the government is not allowed in America! If Trump contends that parts of this book are not true, let him prove it and further prove than Wolff wrote those parts with ""actual malice"" (i.e., knowing the content was not true), and if he can prove those things, then Wolff might owe him damages. THAT is his remedy -- not to quash the book before it's ever been published. So sad that our current President knows so little about the First Amendment. I am happy to spend my 15 bucks to help make Mr. Wolff's work a monster best-seller.",January-10-2018,5

If you support Trump, I doubt if you will read it, or believe any part of it.Michael Wolff had access to to the White House and the people close to Trump. He uses first hand knowledge, conversations, and hearsay to paint a picture of a man who many believe should not be President of the United States.This review is not going to debate the issue of competency, but rather the writing in the book. Wolff repeats himself throughout the book and tends to ramble in parts. His sentence structure tends to be long and convoluted at times. The writing felt rushed and I was expecting deeper insights but was disappointed.There is not very much in the book that the public does not already know or suspect, with one exception. I suspected Trump was easily manipulated by others but not to the extent Wolff describes. Especially by Jared Kushner and Ivanka, and at times Steve Bannon.This one gets three stars. It is a good read, just failed to meet my expectation.",January-24-2018,3

Until 2016, when the naked emperor himself was elected because too many people were unwilling to see the truth.With the refreshing honesty of a child, Michael Wolff dares to say what everyone else is thinking.  Better yet, his experienced voice stands on a mountain of research covered in a forest of verifiable facts.  Reading this isnâ€™t always fun, itâ€™s stomach-churning at times to realize what this wannabe leader is getting away with, but the truth doesnâ€™t have to be pretty to be heard.No wonder the naked emperor tried to stop the production of this book.  Lucky for us, the Constitution still stands and free speech is still important in America.  But only as long as there are those who dare to say what needs to be said, as well as those who are willing to put their money where their mouths are and support the dissemination of the truth.

He really did a good job getting into the putrid meat of the situation. So much so that it made me ill.",May-5-2018,4
780,I bought this book as a result of the Trump staff reaction to it... but honestly if you pay attention to the news and Trump in the media this book isn't going to be revolutionary and frankly it was hardly worth the read. I suppose it will be a nice historical piece for 10 years down the line.,February-22-2018,3

784,"Others have focused on issues related to fact-checking and the obvious point that sourcing is loose in many places. But the overall thrust does not appear to be disputed. The big problem with this book is that it really needed a lot more editorial attention. This is not just in the realm of copy editing and fact checking, but in the overall continuity of the narrative and the sudden appearance and disappearance of characters throughout the text. This might have been a device intended to mirror the chaos within the administration, but it just renders the whole book really confusing.",January-21-2018,3
785,"Michael Wolff's account of the Trump administration is truly frightening and amazing. He managed to get behind the scenes access to the West Wing and got his sources to open up about their perspective on the alarming events and backstabbing that seem so pervasive in this administration. Not all of it is completely believable and there have been many accusations of inaccuracy and distortion leveled at the book. Wolff admits that he was relying on the differing  perspectives and experiences of his hundreds of sources and leaving it to the reader to sort it all out. That seems like a lot to ask, but it is fair in a way, given the heightened sense of partisanship right now. Even though the book only came out a couple of months ago, it seems like the continuing spate of wild events in the administration have quickly outdated it. Yet it remains relevant as it sheds light on many of the current players in the administration and how they are seem by others who either remain there, have left, or are on their way out. All in all, an amazing piece of reportage, despite its flaws.",February-8-2018,4

792,"HE IS WHO WE THOUGHT HE WAS.  Arrogance and blustering and pontificating by Trump by all members of the Trump White House is exactly as you would expect.  If ALL of this is Fiction, as Trumpsters would have you believe - then Donald Trump's entire presidency is Fiction - and Sadly is Not.  If Trump had HALF the Acumen his devotees claim, he would ignore this.  He doesn't.  He hates negative exposure. He is the true life Emperor with No Clothes... that fact remains. America will end up with the same Fate if we do not Shed and Regain Control over the vast TRAINWRECK that is Donald Trump, his Administration, his Entourage.  Mr. Wolff could only be 75% accurate (per Trump Advocates) and we still can recognize TRUTH as well all through this book.  25% fallacy or untruth is not enough to discredit this book.  That many of the people quoted are Dead Silent is enough basis to Believe much of the narrative. If nothing else, Trump takes on a Entourage with Extreme Like Thinking.  It is Frightening that DT's Representatives can go on Countless talk shows (while Mocking him and rolling their eyes behind his back) AND Represent DT as a Honorable Patriot.  Only years ago, while acknowledging that things are not always as they seem - America Was Fundamentally about Democracy, Freedom, Patriotism and Equity .  This Election signifies a deeply crevasse through the Population.Bottom Line is Donald Trump cannot possibly attain the Intelligence, Dignity and Courage shown by his predecessor President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton (and others).

It reads like a novel and compels the reader to keep going.  with all the hype before it was released, I was prepared to be just a little critical, but that lasted for all the time it took to turn a few pages.  It was very difficult to put this book down.  Wolfe crafts a detailed picture of a disturbed, ill-equipped, petty tyrant and the ridiculous cast of characters who have fawned over his every breath and turned the White House into a chaotic funny farm.  Even more disturbing is the fact that this overgrown toddler has his finger on the nuclear football and there are few, if any, around him who have the courage to stop him.  It will keep you up nights long after you read it, but if you care about our country,you need this book.",January-16-2018,5

Because this administration has only parity with 3 distinct warring groups within the administration, no one knows what in fact in going on. Trump wonâ€™t or canâ€™t read.

To hear that Bannon was, or THOUGHT he was, behind all the ""good"" ideas in the Trump White House was funny, scary, and, at times, downright flabbergasting. To hear how much the administration truly did hate one another was disconcerting to say the least.I've heard the Michael Wolff prides himself on writing about people in an unfavorable fashion, so it was a surprise when some of his judgements seemed to cast Trump in a favorable light. Mind you, not too many, of course, but they're there all the same.Though this book seemed to go backwards then forward in time at most inopportune moments, it was overall a good read.",May-2-2018,4
811,"Nothing really new, but facinating to read this narrative of exeptional events. Very well written",January-20-2018,4
812,Wolff was clearly in the White House and had the access he said he had. Trump lies again.  Well worth reading.,January-15-2018,5
813,Written so well it HAS to be 100 percent true.It has been over a year and I keep wondering if I'll wake up from this nightmare...Donald J. Trump is POTUS.God help us all.This should be required reading for every American.,January-11-2018,5
814,"...this is well worth the reading.  If you go on the premise, as I have, that Wolff has notes and recordings to back up his writing, then there is a high degree of likelihood that more than 95% of this recounting is accurate.",February-7-2018,5
815,"I knew things were bad, but this book opened my eyes to JUST how bad things actually are in the current administration. Inexperienced, power-hungry people trying to control a man with horrific personality flaws. Sounds like a winning combo for the American people.",January-16-2018,5
816,"I canâ€™t say Iâ€™m enjoying the read because the information in the book is so distressing.  I do, however, believe every word and Iâ€™m glad the author had the guts to write it. I watched a book panel with Wolff last night and itâ€™s clear that heâ€™s a truth teller.",February-7-2018,5
817,"Even with its reputation for mixing flair with integrity, this book offers insight on the most astonishing White House in history. If you knew nothing about this President other than the tweets you've read, you'd still find the content rhyming with what you know but with details you never imagined.",April-14-2018,4
818,I've had this for months and am only about halfway through.  I'm a little disappointed that any of the interesting parts were already revealed on tv before the book was released  I am enjoying reading about the chaos in the White House since I'm very anti-Trump but it's not exactly an exciting read.  I probably should have bought the kindle version to read on my iPad instead.  I was imagining this was going to be exciting and I'd be willing to lend it to friends so I thought the hardback was more practical. I'm determined to finish but it's easy to put down.,April-5-2018,3
819,The first year of the accidental president veers from thriller to farce. Great reporting by a fly on the wall.,January-13-2018,5
820,Waiting on my copy.  Reading the reviews I am patiently waiting to delve in to what I already know.  Having done my homework on this person I expect no less than a reaffirmation that this character should never have been elected to the August surroundings of past Presidents in the White House.  Couldn't stand to watch him on The Apprentice and cannot stand looking at his mug now. God help the USA!,January-21-2018,5
821,"Oh, dear. No words. I only know Iâ€™m â€œyellowingâ€ù half the book. Itâ€™s mind boggling. Also, have to pause every few pages to look up the amazing words Wolff has appropriately chosen. Well written.",January-23-2018,5
822,"There is a lot in the book that goes with known information, so I believe it all. The material could stand on its own, but the author really brought it all together well and made it extremely interesting. A great book!",February-13-2018,5
823,"While I enjoyed the salacious nature of the book, I'm still wondering if it's actual fact or just the writer's opinion. While I'm sure there are factual items in this book, I'm still just a bit sceptical, Trump is bad in my humble opinion, but is all of this truly going on? Time will tell I'm certain. I believe tRump is a lying, cheating scum who's sole purpose is to line his pockets & stroke his HUGE ego, along with stealing from our country. I wish the author had put down his thesaurus and wrote more down to earth,  it felt like big word day in every paragraph, kind of annoying & made the book (for me) less believable no matter how much I wanted to believe.",March-8-2018,3
824,"The actual information in the book is interesting, but the writing is atrocious. There are TONS of Long run-on sentences. Most paragraphs have asides (example: See Jane - who thought way too much of herself - run). The author seems to be fond of using $50 words when 50 cent words would be easier for the average reader and better help the author to get his point across. Itâ€™s really a shame because the story is great, but reading the story is tedious at best. I wonder if an editor even looked at the manuscript. If the manuscript was edited that editor needs to find a new line of work.",February-5-2018,3
825,Can't put this book down although I find myself in a depressed mood after reading.  My thoughts and feelings about the goings on at the WH are confirmed.  It's not just my imagination it really is in-fighting and chaos.  Frightening!,January-10-2018,5
826,Even if not everything is 100% true or correct it does give you a look at the most corrupt and crazy administration ever!  A lot of stories by others who have worked at the White House collaborate some of the stories.,February-15-2018,5
827,"I am still reading it, almost finished, and I am really impressed that the author didnâ€™t have to put in cheap stuff about Trumpâ€™s sex life, it was so interesting and Iâ€™m loving it because it really shows how we have gotten to this point, a very, very dumb and disgusting president. I also, even though I donâ€™t and never did like Bannon, think he is very smart and his remarks are hilarious !",February-4-2018,5
828,I liked reading the backstory of all that moved Donald Trump toward election as President. I appreciated coming to know the reality of the Trump family--who and what each of them is.If I disliked any aspect of the book it would have been my occasional question as to whether all of it was true as written. But it was a great read and I am recommending it to everyone.,February-12-2018,5

831,"as explosive as it is riveting, this book is worth the time in reading it, despite the moronic nature of its subjects, the oily nature of its author, or the shaming of the Twink in Chief, Jared. But that being said, is it really so difficult a proposal to correct the spelling errors, typos, and grammar mistakes? _Ÿ‘__Ÿè¿",February-7-2018,3
832,"Still reading but learning more than I wanted to about the dark Trump administration.  We're in trouble with this one, folks!",January-25-2018,5
833,Sounded reasonable after all the tweets and leaks. And frankly the rambling speeches like the one at the C.I.A. which is reprinted. It's a companion piece to part of season one of the most chaotic reality show armed with nukes.,January-16-2018,5
834,"Not as well written as I had anticipated.  I expect the writing and editing were rushed to get the book out in print while the news was fresh.  However, it is a fast read and I found it well worth reading because it put the whole story together in reasonably clear perspective.  If you haven't read it yet, you may find that it is all already old news.",March-26-2018,4
835,"Fabulous book!!  This really demonstrates the racist, sexist, narcissistic, inept, unqualified person who is, unfortunately, the â€œleader of the free worldâ€ù.  God help us all.  2020 will never come soon enough.",February-27-2018,5
836,"So much fun to dig into, although Iâ€™ve only just begun reading it. The prologue opens with Steve Bannon charging into an Upper East Side dinner party, three hours late, and regaling Roger Ailes, et. al., about how he was going to re-order the globe, like heâ€™s playing Risk or Battleship or something, barely acknowledging Candidate Trump as anything more than a playing piece. So great.",March-8-2018,5
837,"A Lot of infighting, and Bannon's  view of things. What Trump thinks not so much...none of them belong in politics.",January-8-2018,4
838,My wife loves the book and feels the same about that egomaniac in Washington,February-8-2018,5
839,"This book appears to capitalize on Steve Bannon's distorted interpretation of his relationship (former relationship) with the president, as well as the subjective and over-inflated impact of Bannon's role in White House matters. Much of the information is unsourced; what is sourced has either already been published in newspaper accounts of the early months of the new regime or is implicitly sourced from Steve Bannon, who is hardly a reliable narrator. The result is a sensationalized narrative that, while it reveals the chaos among members of the White House inner circle, offers little balance from other ""inside"" sources to help the reader to determine whether any of it is true. I would not recommend it if the reader is searching for facts.",February-20-2018,3

843,"I just loved the story and the mayhem and craziness.  The only disappointment is that 45 seems to be one of those that craves and thrives on chaos!  But even for those types there's a downfall!  I've got the patience and it's almost Mueller Time!  This book was a GREAT ""pick me up"" when we were feeling a bit weary, job well done in resounding the call Michael, you've restarted the resistance and gathered the troops!!",March-12-2018,5
844,"Love the book so far, canâ€™t wait to finish it. Glad I preordered it currently sold out.",January-10-2018,5
845,"The only thing more enjoyable than reading this book was watching the Trump Administration give it credibility.  I got to the part where it describes Stephen Miller as someone who couldn't be taken out in public without screeching grievances, and about choked on my coffee when he did exactly this 20 minutes later talking to Jake Tapper on TV.  There is no way the anecdotes in this book aren't true.  Not to mention that Trump is mad at Bannon over this whole thing, that's not a dead give away.Oh yeah, the book is actually well written, and an enjoyable read, even aside from the self-immolating subject matter it covers.",January-7-2018,5
846,The book is not perfect but it is extremely interesting and I can't wait for the sequel! You feel like you are sitting there with the author in the White House.  It helps to understand how this White House is run.,February-11-2018,5
847,"Set against a backdrop of incoherent speeches and childlike impulsive decisions, this book gives a voice to what readers can only imagine the people closest to Trump were thinking.  Mostly along the lines of â€œWhat the hell did I get myself into?â€ù  Reading this book is alarming, but not very surprising.  I feel angrier at the people who allowed Trump to happen and those who accepted places in his government.  They turned their backs on the welfare of their country.  They aided and abetted a man who is clearly unfit to be President.  The book did have some minor editorial issues.  It is more like a final draft than a published book, but the information it contains, the way it puts certain events in context, make it important reading in these dangerous times.  The American people deserve full disclosure.",January-7-2018,5
848,This was a good read though with some problematic  editing. I would give the book a higher rating if I knew the book were true or were simply fiction. Its a great story. And it certainly tracks with what we can see on the news. I won't hold my breath that this book will change anything. It won't change anyone's mind.,January-11-2018,3

850,"I want to be clear...  I'm a Registered Republican.  I have voted the party line since I turned 18.  This past election changed all that.  The expose of all of the dirty laundry of the Republican Party and the literal raping of the world that has been going on since #45 took office makes me physically ill.  I'm buying this book, not to convince me....  no, that has happened already....  but because I'm EYES WIDE OPEN NOW....  and I can STILL vote in the primaries!  AND BECAUSE HE TRIED TO STOP THE PUBLICATION.  I don't care if you're Democrat, Republican or Other...  BUY THIS BOOK.  Why?

We are too strong for that.",January-7-2018,5
851,"The book confirmed all my worst fears about Donald Trump and the people surrounding him. It will be years before we recover from all the (damages, missteps, destruction, ill-considered choices, lies) etc. I am happy the book was written; it will further exposed him and his inept way of doing things that are clearly wrong. He is guilty of many things such as collusion, miscarriage of justice and more.",February-20-2018,5
852,It's a wake up call to the dangers of electing an unstable and narcissistic guy to the White House and what it means to the future of our country. Michael Wolff has provided an insider view into a dysfunctional presidency led by a deranged person. Thank you Michael for the courageous commentary.,January-10-2018,5
853,"Captivating book! Though there's been a lot of controversy about it, following the news as avidly as I do (through reliable, reputable venues), I find it all completely credible.

I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it.  I don't think it would be worth it, being barely over 300 pages long.  I hate #45, before and after the read.  It does emphasize the fact that he is childish and has an extremely short attention span.",February-24-2018,3

865,"Great read! Not a frontal attack on Trump at all and does not contain editorializing...but is an impressionistic masterpiece that through anecdote and story telling leaves you feeling like you know the guy. A simple but psychologically complex man who seems to have a number of persona's and serious pathologies that you are infuriated with but at other times can understand that one on one he seems like such a great guy to be around. I guess I could understand why guys like Lindsey Graham could go from being a thoughtful critic of him to a great friend after playing golf with him. Like many successful conmen he makes people one on one feel like he is a harmless baby who cares about you and you can't believe under his spell he could hurt a fly or be guilty of anything. And I think when he is in his angelic mode he is not faking it. He is just schizo! Not a manipulator like Eddie Haskell, but a true shapeshifter of psychopathic proportions.",January-6-2018,5

870,"Not only did it give insight into the  turmoil of the West Wing, it was, at times,  unintentionally prophetic regarding  happenings that occurred from the White House after the book was published.  Surprisingly, he gave more credit to and excused more behavior of Trump's people than I had expected him to do.  I only gave it three stars instead of four  because of Wolff's writing style.  In an attempt to impress he used many archaic terms which was totally unnecessary and didn't make for a fluid reading experience.",March-25-2018,3
871,"Of course I was going to read this to see what it was all about. My biggest takeaway: the oversized male ego and how it creates conflict and problems. You have four men, Trump, Bannon, Kushner and Priebus who all think they are right and know how to best lead the country and none of them are working toward a common goal. Itâ€™s all about them and what they individually think is best. I think this is the main reason why this administration looks like a mess. Too many cooks in the kitchen mentality. The women in this administration are struggling to find a way to actually get work done and are constantly being distracted or upended by the â€œmy d*** is bigger than yoursâ€ù refrain. No communication, no management skills, no cohesive strategies. Until they can all sit down and agree on what they hope to accomplish during this first term, I donâ€™t know how it can get any better. Honestly, even if I didnâ€™t agree with them on a certain policy, I would feel better about the leadership on America if they all got on the same page and werenâ€™t appearing to wing it everyday.

Bannon's views especially re the Mueller lawyer hires (his first hire was of a money laundering prosecutor expert)  is revealing of where this looks like Trump's business interests WILL get looked into, finally, and where the Mueller trail will lead, is implied thus.  The Jarvanka (Jared and Ivanka) camp have won over Bannon's camp, but politically Bannon was correct about Trump's winning, when the Trump family all thought  they were putting up a show and would lose, and  it would be ""over"" thankfully.  The unpreparedness and the amateur missteps began.  I would have wanted even more details but if a reader had been reading  the NY Times and Wash Post, this book gives more on the ground, West Wing leakers' beefs, those who left the West Wing in the first 6 months of the Trump presidency.  The book also gives a feel for the Murdoch and Ailes and Mercer influence.  The book reveals of Trumps evening phone calls to the ""billionaires"" so it gives the implied influence on Trump's mind of his evening phone called friends, whoever they are, who have Trump's ear.

But it's so poorly sourced it could never be proven.",February-21-2018,2
900,"I liked the writing style. It is very readable. It seemed authentic because it merely fleshed out what I already suspected. However, it organized it very nicely, so you could see the competing spheres of influence at work in the Whitehouse. It underlined the dysfunction of both the administration and the President well. I think the author has been unfairly vilified. I'm sure he took some liberties with the details to imagine what people were thinking, what was said behind closed doors, and what people may have done, but the overall ambience seemed very credible. Steve Bannon obviously was a prolific source and much of the book focuses on his perspective and character. The author suggests that people just read the book and see if it makes sense. I would suggest the same thing.",March-7-2018,5
901,"Wolff takes all the headlines we already know, combines them with his fly-on-the wall perspective of the people involved, and creates a coherent and gripping story. Steve Bannon is a sympathetic--and tragic--villain. Trump is a reckless egomaniac, surrounded by a group of incompetent and highly ambitious courtiers and confidants. He's good at doing the voices too. And because this presidency is still only just over a year old, it adds to the suspense.My favorite passages are where Bannon is talking freely about Jared and Ivanka. Good reading!",January-10-2018,5
902,"waiting for my copy today, probably will stay up all night until I finish it. Then I will gift wrap it, give to one of my republican friends who will not read it and simply say the book is all B.S.",January-25-2018,5

904,This is a sad beginning for a president who was not familiar with Washington politics. The author describes the different factions and their agendas as well as reach group's opinion of the leader's ability to govern. It is a picture of what voters get when electing someone from outside the beltway who has no experience in government.,March-11-2018,3

906,"Wolf has reported his observations in this dysfunctional White House and painted a picture that reinforces and occasionally provides insight.  It is a snapshot of what anyone breathing was already aware.  Two points that result in a low rating:  He is one of ""them"" and reveals this in the way he reports his observations and the conclusions frequently drawn.  And he perpetuates the manipulation of history to serve not his goals but his buy-in to the fundamental decay of the GOP and their role in the election of this threat to the Republic.",February-10-2018,2

914,"I have read and watched Trump for 30 years out of curiosity.  Read Art of The Deal, Trumpland, the many articles in New York Times, Vanity Fair, and so many more.  Trump doesn't read.  Trump is uneducated.  Trump is a whore to the extreme.  Trump is a grifter.  Trump has no business sense.  Yet IQ45 got elected President on a platform of racism, anger, sexism, misogyny, and promises he will never keep?  Fascinating.Wolff's book is delicious.  Of course it's true as he has references and recordings.  The book was rushed out(after Trump attacked it) and that's why there so many errors.  Who cares just read it!!!!!!What is beyond horrific is his children our helping run the USA!  Nazis in the White House!!!!  And Russians in the oval office!!!!!

917,"Good Listen (audio book version). I have three books opened already so I purchased this one as an audio book to listen to while driving around.Very compelling and eye opening information. It provides a fly on the wall kind of experience that the author was trying to instill into the reader/listener.  Some very interesting points are made that help you gain further insight into the motivations and psychological idiosyncrasies of the players in the Trump White House. After listening to three hours of this 11 hour audio book I am riveted in my continuation to listen as each day unveils more of this nightmarish drama on television. The book provides an enlightenment that helps to bring a better understanding of what drives this man that so many foolishly voted in as president of the United States.The book paints Trump as a narcissistic genius, who didn't understand his own power of persuasion of the masses. His of lack of presence-of-being and his control of the media is an alarm sounding. America needs to stop looking at celebrities as saviors of the universe. The corruption of American politics is encompassing, however we can not even start to think of eliminating this corruption when we ask the wolves to guard the sheep.Even if 1/3 of what this author writes is true, it is enough for everyone to be concerned with the presidency of Trump. I am deeply concerned for our country.",January-22-2018,4
918,Resist!,January-5-2018,5
919,I only bought this book because of the Presidentâ€™s attempts to suppress it. I once took an oath to uphold the constitution and I take that oath seriously. Whatâ€™s going on in the White House is appalling. I hope  the Republican members of Congress remember the oaths they once took and take steps to protect the constitution and our democracy.,January-7-2018,5

924,"This is an an acute observation of the Trump Whitehouse: anecdotal but first hand, chaos from the couch. It is fun to read like a good Vanity Fair article. It was written and published in a hurry but it is timely and so so disheartening. This President may, unless a miracle transofromarion occurs,be the worst mistake America has ever had.",January-24-2018,5
925,"After reading this book Iâ€™m amazed that Trump has lasted this long as President. The Republican Party leaders, Ryan and McConnell, turn a blind eye to this White House circus as long as they have a â€œPresident who will sign anything they put in front of himâ€ù. Trump is a child like bully who thrives on constant, in the moment, praise. He is neither intelligent or a deal maker. He appears to be constantly out of touch and delusional. To me, it seems like Trump is acting in another reality TV show where the only thing that matters is his ratings. He is truly unfit for this office and remains a constant threat to our free press and our Democracy.",January-11-2018,4

934,The book gives a clear inside view of the White House daily function and the major players of Trumpâ€™s administration. I understand more of where the Mueller investigation is going.,March-9-2018,5
935,"Now, I have to preface this by stating that I hate Trump, and believe he is a dangerous and deranged person, and the worst President to serve during my long life.  Much of what was in the book we have all heard or suspected, but there was a lot more here that we did not know.  The author was able to put all the goings on in perspective, making the reader feel like the ""fly on the wall"".  It is funny, but all that has gone on since the end of this book could probably fill another complete book.  I thought the book was very well done, and I just hope more people will read this and take it to heart, and VOTE.  Although some things may have been built out of proportion to the actual events since much information was gained from others relating events, if only a fraction of it was purely factual, that orange buffoon has NO business being the leader of this country.",January-29-2018,5

940,"The book is a remarkable account of perhaps the most dysfunctional power center that ever existed. No matter what side of the center youâ€™re on, you do not want the content of this book to be true. Having had said that, it has been written in a sneaky way, with quotes mingled articulately within opinions making it sound like a continuous truth telling or a factual exposeâ€™. Not far from it, though, the book is clearly written as an extended blog with gaping editorial guffaws. The sentence construct at places seem ridiculous with embedded parentheses making it almost impossible to find the initial premise and conclusion of the argument presented. The content itself however compensates for it being a painful read.  Rings true for most part, and depicts a likely Trump White House.",February-7-2018,4
941,This a no nonsense approach for anyone seeking confirmation of what most of us already know. Our government is a circus and trump is the lead clown. Good read.,January-23-2018,5
942,"First, when the subject doesnâ€™t want you to read it, it goes without saying the subject makes it a best seller. So here I am reading the making of a President. Second, this book confirms to me is that ANYONE can be the president of the US. This just acknowledged what I knew already, he is an incompetent nincompoop and I can only hope we (the US) gets through this intact.",January-6-2018,5
943,Very interesting read. It gives insight into the narcissistic sociopathy that is in all too high a position.  It's 'The Emperor Has No Clothes' of modern times; only this version isn't a work of fiction.,January-29-2018,4

951,"This book did not disappoint. Woolf clearly had a birds-eye view of the shenanigans afoot in The White House and the crazy clown car that trump was careening around in without knowledge or a license. Bannon was his wing man and the rest of the ""staff"" were fighting each other in the back. What had been an open secret in Washington was finally exposed for the country (and the world) to see. A malevolent Bannon used trump to enact his own destructive view of the way things should be, while the Kushners and the GOP vied for what was left over. Without values or beliefs, trump listened to whomever gave him the best or most recent pitch. Bannon's dark views grabbed him for a long stretch. Michael Woolf has done us all a solid favor, not only by shining a light on what a nothing trump is, but hopefully also has saved us from Bannon running for president in 2020.",January-22-2018,5

957,"Although dismissed by Donald Trump, this book is quite believable and speaking as someone who once lived in the United States , Donald Trump seems completely unlike any other President before him.  It was hard to keep up with the names of many of the persons mentioned in the book, with the departure of so many key people since.If Donald Trump can bring a successful outcome from his planned meeting with Kim Jong Un, he could yet go down in history as a significant President of modern times.",April-1-2018,5
958,"Michael Wolff provides readers a behind-the scenes look at the ever-shifting hierarchy of the White House staff during the first year of President Trump's administration, largely told from the perspective of former Presidential strategist Steve Bannon.

959,I bought the kindle versions so I didnâ€™t have to wait.  Excellent read and reaffirms what Iâ€™ve heard about our President!,January-9-2018,5
960,"I was not going to buy this book, but decided to buy it when Trump tried to stop its publication.  I am glad I bought it because it helped bring some clarity as to what has been going on behind the scenes in the White House.  The book also provided background information about the cast of characters, and how they became involved with the campaign and the White House.  I generally tend to be skeptical, but I believe that the majority of what is in this book is true.  One criticism of the book is the writing style, which consists of many sentences broken up with dashes.  This writing style seemed disjointed and often required rereading of sentences to try to make sense of them.  Another criticism is that the author makes statements regarding thoughts, opinions and conclusions of various characters and White House staff, but does not explain the source.  Much of what is in the book has already been reported by journalists or documented in past interviews, but I think that this book adds some new perspective and helps us understand why events have occurred.",January-18-2018,4
961,Very good and informative. Worth the price,February-6-2018,5

Itâ€™s easy to read and understand, so even a President should enjoy it.

972,"It is well written, better than expected, but there was very little new information that hadn't already been in the media or in excerpts of the book that were published prior to its release.

976,"This is a very well written book. It has helped me get my head around what is really happening in the White House. I think it serves a purpose in that what isn't known is often scarier than what is known...even if what is known is abhorrent. Somehow reading about all the ineptitude that occurs around and with POTUS makes it a bit less depressing. If you don't know the details, you default to a position of all those working in the White House share POTUS views. But, after reading Wolff's book, we see that most if not all of these people share our disbelief and disapproval of his actions.They all try to influence him in order to further their agendas, but alas...in most cases he just does what sounds good to him in the moment. Everything he does is by the seat of his pants with no thought attached. He is a scary man in a very scary time. I can only hope that he is removed from office before serving the full term. If not, it is going to be a very LONG 4 years.",January-12-2018,5
977,"It was like a cheap soap opera... but hey, the author is the last person to blame for that.A light and fun read, pretty insightful as well.Even though, I wouldn't necessarily take all of it as truth.

The way to get me to avoid a book is to assign it.We picked up the Kindle and the Audible but it wasn't WhisperSynched. So I gave up trying to get them to work together and chose to listen to the author read his book. He did very well. And his writing kept the reader engaged.As for the information, it is all the stories we have seen acted out since last January. It often felt like reruns but just when you felt that, you would see newer information as to why those things might have happened. Not from the author's eye but his eyewitnesses who gave testimonies of what they had seen/lived in the White House.I'm not going to tell you to read it. You will or you won't.

Wolff, a splendid writer, has been criticized as a poor reporter, but F&F; isnâ€™t â€œreportingâ€ù in the usual sense - itâ€™s a tone poem of chaos and madness, and thoroughly believable. (His disparaging critics have yet to identify serious misstatements).",January-18-2018,5
987,"While i did feel kinda trashy reading F+F, it was very insightful into the unfortunate current state of american politics.People should know what is going on. Plus it has a kind of tabloid like appeal; sadly, its so outlandish and matches so well with the bizarre events we've all been witness to that it has to be true (plus noone in the book has substantively denied any of it) ;_;highly recommend tho, very entertaining, very insightful, well written. In short, a great page turner and meaningful distraction",March-7-2018,5

If only half of what Wolff writes is true, it's still a scandal of epic proportions. It seems organic, normal and totally believable. People will decide for themselves. Just remember, even up to Nixon's impeachment, most Republicans still held the belief Nixon had done nothing wrong. Release of the tapes and the Congressional and Special Counsel investigations proved he was a dirty as could be. Still people supported Nixon up to the end. I wonder how they feel now that all those tapes and papers have been released, and we know the depth of Nixon's criminal behavior. I think we will see the same thing now. Anyway, read it and judge for yourself. Think critically.",February-20-2018,4
990,"Just as compelling as advertised. Fire and Fury made me feel as if I were a fly on the wall in all the busiest rooms in the White House. And, yes, I also feel slightly gross. Is every word true?

Far far better than the usual slapdash quickie political book.",January-24-2018,5

995,"Highly recommended!  I expected a trashy potboiler but what I got was a gripping, serious read.  Wolff comes across a little flaky in his TV interviews but I was very surprised by the quality of the writing--and I'm a picky, hyper critical reader.  I learned a lot and couldn't put it down -- and was sad when it ended.  I hesitated to buy the book at first because I figured that all the ""good"" quotes were being aired on TV.  Not so.  There's a lot in here that helped me understand much more than I already knew about the goings-in in the Trump Whitehouse.  Wolff is very insightful.  This doesn't read like a hatchett job; instead, I feels like a realistic portrayal written by a serious author who was (and is) seriously alarmed about the situation in the West Wing.  Everyone should read this book.",January-11-2018,5

997,"Fully anticipating a tabloid format of salacious gossip, I was surprised to find some solid political analysis and keen observation of character.  Surprisingly,  no one in the Trump White House seemed to evoke any admiration from the author.  Wolff painstakingly reveals the artifice and plot ting from the various factions.  Had the President a clear view of his own, he would not have surrounded himself with such disparate entities.  Had he made purposeful rather than spontaneous gut level choices, the first year might have evolved much differently.  The anti-Midas touch has destroyed the careers of many staff members.  Overlooked supporters like Christie and Giuliani can thank their lucky  stars that they avoided the heat of that Sun.",February-27-2018,4

The country is divided in opinion with little reference to fact so its all loaded. Without critical thinking, we are living in the dark ages where our behavior is based on what we think, rarely on what is true. Truth is always burried under a mask of emotion; when in conversation our argument becomes tight, know we are no longer interested in the truth bur rather being right. In this culture, today, that seems to lead most of what people have to say.Iâ€™ll close by saying Iâ€™m pleased that I read the book and I encourage others to do the same.

The reader doesn't care if the author is brilliant or a dope, only that the content is credible and accurate.So filling a book with typos doesn't help your argument for accuracy.I understand the publisher's excitement in rushing this publication into distribution, but the typos were numerous.The worst: the dropped ""L"" in discussing Mr. Bannon's first pubic experience.That's pretty embarrassing.Good editing is a essential to a good book.

1019,"MUCH MORE Than just a ""tell all"" or gossip rag type book. It explained the 3 factions that war within the White House and where each player is coming from and what they're trying to get out of the experience. Many of the people in the WH are there to try to ride the coat-tails of the presidency and all it can do for their personal ""brands"". No one is there to serve the country. They are there to serve their own pocketbooks. It's a big grab for the wealth of the nation. It clearly outlines the limitations of this president's attention span and his inability to focus, his inability to make decisions, his extreme dysfunction in just wanting people to like him, and yet his profound cruelty. He's extremely dependent on people who don't know anything about the government but do know how to ""handle"" his moods. This White House is more about handling the man's moods and tempers than it is about doing anything for the country. They don't even think about what's good for the country. They only think about what serves THEIR PERSONAL AGENDAS. It's a warning. If this man is not removed and if we do not rebuild our government, then we're a leaderless country in one way, yet about to become a tyrannical dictatorship also. He hasn't filled positions in the WH because he wants to be the master, yet he doesn't even know what a person who gets citizenship has to know to pass the test! He only wants people loyal to him, not necessarily people who are even qualified. There's a lot of magical thinking in the WH and not much seriousness about what they're doing. They have no concept of history and so they can't learn from history. They're such a far cry from the educated and aware people we've had so far that it's beyond scary. After reading this book, I could easily follow and expound upon the various characters and their agendas, and the waves and trends in the WH and why they exist and where they're coming from. All this in an entertaining style that's easy to read Maybe even Trump could read some of it, who knows? The writer practically lived in the WH for many months, setting up shop on a couch, and he had access to everything, being able to wander in and out of offices and listen to and watch conversations. There is no method or protocol in this WH, so it was wide open for him to just take notes and tape conversations. People came to him to sound off and he made it all into a book. It's probably the greatest insight into any White House that we've ever had, because his access is unprecedented! If you only read one book about all this, read this one. you'll understand the players and underlying forces pretty well after reading this.",March-4-2018,5

The latter part of the title leads us into the content of the book that allows us a ""fly on the wall"" view of the fury that fuels the chaos in the West Wing of the White House.

1037,"I have recently finished reading Michael Wolffâ€™s Fire and Fury, an account of the Trump administration which spans a period of time from before the election of 2016 up through early October of 2017.  It is a comprehensive look into a presidential administration torn apart by in-fighting and a constant struggle to just survive, much less accomplish anything of great import.  At the center of this swirling mess is a petulant man-child who is deliberately under-informed, easily bored, and prone to sudden tantrums.Wolffâ€™s accounting of life in the Trump administration is so heavy with details and facts, that it has to be the product of someone who was very close to the center of the storm.  His vignettes are so specific that one must suppose much of what he witnessed was actually recorded.  Perhaps that is why he has yet to be sued over the content of his book.Fire and Fury gives an overlay of the functioning of the Executive Branch of our government under Trump..  Wolff describes three distinct camps within the White House that fought for Trumpâ€™s ear and control of the agenda.  One of those factions was headed by the odious Steve Bannon, an man whose personal agenda was  to forge a path of destruction across the federal landscape by eliminating agencies and programs and using executive orders to erase much of the legacy of the Obama administration.A second faction was the standard political types as represented by Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.  Priebus was Trump's connection with the leaders of Congress, and he functioned as the GOP's point man in the Trump White House.The third faction was what has come to be called â€œJarvankaâ€ù by the popular press â€“ and it refers to Trumpâ€™s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka and Jared Kushner,  who literally moved into the White House on inauguration day.  Both functioned as representatives of more progressive ideas â€“ and Bannon snidely referred to them as â€œNew York Democratsâ€ù and â€œthe geniuses.â€ù  Wolff acknowledges Ivanka as the â€œdefactoâ€ù First Lady.Leaks are not uncommon in porous institutions, such as the White House, and every administration has had to ferret out leakers and deal with them.  The leaks that occurred in the early months of the Trump presidency appeared to be far more numerous than those that Trumpâ€™s predecessor had to endure, and they often served to fuel Trumpâ€™s rages and erratic behaviors.  Wolff credits most of the leaks to Bannon and Jarvanka, as each jockeyed to make the other look incompetent.  Priebus, who was steadfastly trying to advance the Republican wish list, did not  seem to engage in the same level of subterfuge as the other two factions within the White House.,Eventually Priebus aligned more-or-less with Bannon, and eventually both of those players lost their positions of influence in the White House.  Priebus was replaced by General John Kelly who came in with three goals:  to oust Bannon (which he did), to  oust, or at least limit the influence of Jarvanka  (a task at which he had only limited success - but is still pursuing), and to reign â€“in  Trump (a task at which he failed miserably).The value of this book to me is that it gives a framework which seems to explain Trumpâ€™s behavior - even up through the present.  Something bites him in the butt or just irritates him, and he heads to Twitter.  Then, as often as not, the reader can refer back to Wolffâ€™s book and see the genesis of the latest outrage.  Fire and Fury is not a comprehensive atlas of Trumpâ€™s mind, but the book does serve as a quick-reference travel guide to anyone wondering what in Trumpâ€™s history or character led to the latest outburst.As a former history teacher and as a concerned citizen, I heartily recommend this book to anyone seeking to have a clearer understanding of what motivates Donald Trump and where his erratic behaviors are likely going to lead.  It is a spell-binding read.(One caution:  I kept my copy by my bed for evening reading.  The paper cover, featuring a red-faced portrait of an angry Trump, is most unsettling, and I finally removed it.  That made for a better nightâ€™s sleep!)",February-21-2018,5
1038,"Wolff spent quite a lot of time in the White House and interviewed 200 people. From his report, it seems the guy is even worst that we imagined.

1053,"Oh, boy, oh, boy, where does one begin with Michael Wolffâ€™s Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House?Forget for the moment (if you can) what you already know about Donald Trumpâ€™s first year in the White House. Not an easy task by any means. While it might be difficult to approach this book with an open mind and without bias, to fully appreciate this book, you have to suspend all disbeliefâ€”which is also no easy task. Wolff does offer some interesting tidbits of information with his behind-the-scenes examination of Trumpâ€™s rise to the presidency and his first year in office. Youâ€™re going to find yourself shaking and scratching your head and asking yourself, â€œDid I just read what I thought I read?â€ùI found the book to be both hilarious as well as frightening. It does get scary at times, especially in what Wolff reveals about the way Trump thinks or the large role that his son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Invanka (amusingly referred to as Jarvanka) play in the White House as well as the role since-departed Steve Bannon played. Wolff is merciless when it comes to criticizing Trump and his family, but he tends to give Bannon a fair shake. Itâ€™s no wonder that Trump was livid when this book hit the stands.There is something very Shakespearean about the Trump presidency which reveals itself in Wolffâ€™s book. Itâ€™s the Nixon White House all over again.While reading this book, I was reminded of David Halberstamâ€™s brilliant tome, The Best and the Brightest. Although Wolffâ€™s book pales in comparison, there is much to glean from his book. This is as about up close and personal as you are going to get to the Trump presidency and you wonâ€™t feel gypped at the end. And if you believe in the theory that Trump never really intended to become president, this book will not let you down. One thing is for certain, as Wolff points out, the Trump presidency, for all its drama, shortcomings, and anxieties, has most definitely held everybodyâ€™s attention.In the final analysis, readers will take away what they want from this book. If one is anti-Trump, the book will come across as â€œI told you soâ€ù account. On the other hand, if youâ€™re a Trump supporter, this book is just a trove of lies and â€œfake news.â€ù Either way, this book will be the talk of the town for some time. One thing for certain, the book, if you can excuse the pun, is not closed on Trump. Thereâ€™s plenty more to write. Where thereâ€™s smoke, with a nod to the title, thereâ€™s a lot of fire. This is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.â€” Jeffrey Miller, author of Bureau 39",February-2-2018,4

1060,Most if the information in the book was previously known because of media reporting. There were a few incidents I was not aware of however. I did not find it an easy read so it took me longer to read it than most books. I was not familiar with some of the words that just don't show up in everyday speech so it was necessary to look them up unless I just skimmed over them and figured out the meaning from the context of the sentence.

Oh well, let me entomb it now in a little corner of my bookcase together with the Starr Report.",April-30-2018,3
1063,"Overall, pretty good read. Nothing groundbreaking; anyone who watches the news will get almost the same effect. It's basically a confirmation that all of the nonsense that is Donald Trump is in fact true, even behind closed doors. I was hoping to find stuff that wasn't public knowledge, but that really wasn't the case here (which is why I give this four stars). But great writing by Michael Wolf, and even better strategy on getting into Trump's inner circle, albeit brief. It's hilarious to see how simple minded Trump was when allowing Michael Wolf to shadow the day to day operations of the current presidency. It's obvious Trump doesn't read or understand Wolf's background, otherwise he would have had him thrown out. Simple flattery is all it takes for this moron.One last criticism-why the timing on the ""end"" of the book? Wolf should have stayed embedded as long as possible; I'm not sure why he decided to complete the book only one year into the presidency. It would have been an even better read if he stayed with Trump through the end (whatever that may end up looking like).",March-19-2018,4

Instead, I found that a) Wolff is terrific writer with a nice command of language and imagery and b) he provides a good deal of dissection of the how and why's of this disturbing phenomenon. Also refreshing, he's always ready to be critical of both sides. Because honestly, the Republicans are not the only sinners here. Trump is a product of the mass media. Wolff is an expert on the mass media. It's almost more than what I bargained for, because in the end, the final verdict is very scary. There is no ""there"" there. It's like a nightmare I would have when I was little: I'm in the back seat of my parents car, we're driving somewhere and then I look up at the front seat...and no one's driving! That's where we are at in this ""frightening moment in history."" Wolff did his research. He isn't guessing. He knows what he's talking about.

If that's true, then the Peter Principle is alive and well and living in the White House. If you've been watching the news, you''ve heard this all before--nothing to see here, folks.

1076,As a moderate independent voter I'm not for or against any political party. But President Trump made such a big deal about this book I just had to read it to find out what all the controversy was all about. I found the book to be very informative and well written.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in America politics.,January-16-2018,5
1077,Fire and Fury is good if one is looking for a chronicalogical order of what has happened in the Trump candidacy.  It had some interesting bits and pieces in it about things that had not been known during Trumpâ€™s presidency and inside looks about what insiders said about Trump and others in the West Wing. On the whole I did not like the quality of the writing and editing.,February-2-2018,3

1081,"This is a very essential book for understanding the Trump White House. And don't listen to the nonsense right-wing vitriol about the author and the book: It's apolitical. It's simply a fly-on-the-wall view of the first year of the Trump presidency. The fact is, and most sane, reasonable people can see this: Donald Trump, regardless of your political orientation, is totally unfit to be president. He didn't even want to win. In fact, with Bannon out - perhaps the only person with some brains and a vision in the entire administration (though I disagree with his vision), we're basically left with a family affair, with ""Jarvanka"" - Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump - wielding way, way too much influence simply because they are family. It's like we're dealing with a dysfunctional royal family, except we're America, so we shouldn't have to be dealing with this. I also happen to reading Chris Matthews new book on Robert Kennedy, and let me tell you: The juxtaposition is totally jarring. With Kennedy, we're dealing with a man of great moral depth and passion - someone who's rich, like Trump, and doesn't need to be serving his country, but wants to anyway. Why? Because he actually cares about Americans like you and I. Contrast this with Trump: A man whose sole concern seems to be spending time golfing or obsessing about what the mainstream media doesn't love him and what ""big thing"" he needs to do to win the mainstream media approval he pretends he despises but actually craves. The main is a total narcissist who only cares about himself. They say you get the leaders you deserve. With our narcissistic culture of instant gratification, selfies, and addiction to social media, I suppose it's not entirely surprising that we end up with a loser like Trump. God help us. Perhaps the biggest star of the book is Bannon, whose surprisingly ascendance (and perhaps Icarian fall), was both engaging and informed me in ways I hadn't been before. I came away respecting Bannon as a person, even though I really don't go for his politics. Coming from working class Irish roots, he's missed that ""what made America great,"" were precisely the New Deal and Great Society programs that Republicans have been trying to destroy since Reagan. Keep in mind that Americans had the highest standard of living in the world in 1972 and we had a solid middle class. Not so today. This was a right-wing agenda, but eventually - as the democrats have been hijacked by corporate, Wall Street, and military industrial complex interests - became a DC agenda, since whatever party is in office, the same basic economic nonsense (welfare for the rich, tax cuts for the rich, never-ending wars, etc) continues unabated. It's a shame that a man with Bannon's mind has not been able to connect the dots. There's an elite problem, and the ""elite"" are not just liberals. Republicans invented ""the elite.""  Overall, it's a great, essential read. We live in crazy times and this book goes a long, long way to even handedly and fairly pull back the curtain behind this circus.",January-19-2018,4
1082,"Your collection is not complete w/out this book.  Makes you laugh, makes you cry.The language of early pages is poorly written.  Henry Holt hurried the book too fast to the shops.  Read the first pages with pencil in hand.  The rest is OK.  You're gonna love it.",April-18-2018,5
1083,"I loved this book so much I read it twice. I found the author's writing rather cerebral.  He used words I haven't ever heard and I have read a lot. He covered everything we have been told on cable news, but in greater depth. Speaking of Ivanka Trump, Wolf said,""She treated her father with some lightness, even irony, and in at least one TV interview she made fun of his comb-over.""  And, later, another quote, ""Father and Daughter got along almost peculiarly well. She was the real mini-Trump.....she accepted him. She was a helper not just in his business dealing, but in his marital realignments.  She facilitated entrances and exits.""",March-5-2018,5
1084,"Elect a clown; expect a circus.As Wolff meticulously points out, no one in the country thought the third-rate game show host would become president, and no one within his tiny band of corrupt sycophants, including the candidate, wanted it to happen. We have had to live with daily reports of the shame and degradation coming from the White House for a year now, and the author has done an excellent job of giving us a compact and readable chronicle documenting the destruction of the American presidency.Wolff is very up front, telling us in the introduction that he will report the lies told to him and let the reader decide what to make of them. Of course, lies, self-deceit, and outright clinical delusion are hallmarks of the current administration, so this is simply more of the same, but stacked and sorted for our convenience.I bought this book immediately it was available, firstly because I want Wolff to make a lot of money for his efforts, and secondly because it will aggravate the Coward-in-Chief to see the tome on the best seller list. And because some people tried to stop its being published.Resist, and make America America again.",January-5-2018,5
1085,"This book was clearly rushed to print so it is full of typos and it needed some editing HOWEVER, this is a great read. There is nothing in the book that is surprising or shocking but it presents the chain of events in a comprehensive timeline which adds depth, detail and insider perspective into the last year.. It is really more of a book about those around Trump than Trump himself. The book is ""true"" in the sense it is heavily quoted leaving little doubt that the quotes themselves are true. He puts a negative spin on these quotes because I am not sure how a sane person could do otherwise. This is not ""good history"" in the sense that it is exhaustively researched but because of the nature of the Trump presidency even gathering quotes and stories from those around him probably gives you a pretty accurate picture of the man and the administration. This is not a book that could exist in an administration run by sane , competent grown ups.All of this being said, I woke up this morning sad for the American people who do not even have a minor role in this Greek Tragedy.",January-6-2018,5
1086,"Difficult read because difficult to always discern whether the information related was the product of what was said by someone in the three factions, extended, or the President himself, as the ultimate source and cause of the dysfunction: or perhaps  the writer's interpretations and opinions.  The degree of  dysfunction perhaps was made clearer, and the overlapping, competing and intertwined sources of the same. What a tragedy, a cause for despair, and a demonstration of  utter lack of courage, and integrity  for misguided and selfish ends that is displayed and so prominently mimicked by the subject of this book, and others holding leadership positions in our government . Unfortunately this behavior  has created a hey day for some  citizens who think this behavior is a good thing to be imitated, this results in greater peril for this country.",January-28-2018,3

1092,"We already knew Trump was intellectually, morally and temperamentally unfit to serve as president, in this book, we learn he is also cognitively unfit and rapidly declining. The people working at the White House and on Capitol Hill are desperate to manipulate and influence Trump  (Bannon, Priebus, Congressional leaders, Jared and Ivanka, Kelly) but they have conflicting agendas.Ergo, chaos.Americans routinely elect geriatric leaders. There are plenty of elected officials who have undergone cognitive decline while in office, Reagan, Conyers to name a few. We all saw McCain's difficulty live on television during hearings before he was diagnosed. If we are going to continue to vote for people in their 70's and 80's there has to be some kind of cognitive standard and medical evaluation. We elect people, not their staff and deserve to know when they become incapable of doing their job due to impairment.",January-8-2018,5

1102,"Wolff at one point writes ""the Ukraine."" Bad. Simply Ukraine will do. This was definitely a notable cringe in a linguistically antiquated book. Heh.The core of the book is solid. It allows one to really fit some of the observations of Trump with this behind the scenes action to form an opinion of him (or further solidify one.)There are so many articles on this book, I don't think I need to get into a detailed breakdown. If you enjoy reading political dramas, pick this bad boy up. Just take it with a few grains of salt.",January-26-2018,3
1103,"Even if 20% of this book were accurate, it would still be monumentally damaging.  Not a lot of ""new"" info, just confirming what common sense and observation long suspected. Still, an entertaining read, though.",January-20-2018,5
1104,"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, by Michael Wolff, provides the details of a narrative that the media has been exposing since before Donald Trump assumed office as President. The book presents an insightful and particularized approach to presenting the behind-the-scenes picture of life around a man whose ""Presidential"" status has become a daily circus-act, whose very presence in the White House is the result of supporters who themselves had the same element of hate, racism, bigotry, despair and even desperation, that this ill-suited candidate could possibly, with his rants and wild hyperbole and lies, lead the nation to a better place. As one reads the book, and Wolff has done an excellent job of collecting his facts and presenting them, it is a sad picture, revealing, in fact, that American politics has sadly and pathetically diverged from being a service to the people, to another entirely different agenda of suckling up to corporate and financial supporters - mere dogs snooping out the best sources of money and cuddling up to them, while, the American people get the short end of the stick. For all his tooting and wild claims and promises, which most of us could see through as mere political yahoo at the time, Trump clearly has not delivered up and he won't either, and the book clearly shows that the course of this administration is either going to be impeachment, a short career or forced resignation in the face of such humiliation that it will reach a point, we hope, where Republicans, for whatever reason, simply cannot abide to having a racist and incompetent clown heading up the nation. Trump and all is lambasting against the publishing of this book, did the world a great favor, because the book hit the spotlight and I believe that many, like myself, who may never have known about and purchased the book, did so just to add another brick in the wall around Trump, showing him that freedom of speech and freedom of the press is alive and well, and that despite his attempts to create a dictatorship in America, the majority of us are not going to let it happen. Get the book, if only to make a statement.",January-19-2018,4
1105,Entertaining but disturbing story that you can only hope has a lot of fiction in it.

1112,"FIRE AND FURY -Michael WolffBy Bill KingIn the early pages of Fire and Fury Steve Bannon is quoted as saying â€œDay One weâ€™re moving the US Embassy to Jerusalemâ€ù Candidate Trump  speaking of the Clinton team as oppose to his team often said â€œTheyâ€™ve got the best and we got the worstâ€ù On Day-1 in the CIA Speech Trump wearing a Dark Overcoat made him appear as a hulking gangster look . On the Friday the Immigration and Travel Ban went into effect that causes so much chaos thought-out  the country was all Bannonâ€™s doing whoâ€™s attitude was no checking with lawyers, or People in the departments that knew the laws was just to do it and Trump just signed what was placed in front of him. Trump did not  he treat anyone with any sort of basic or reliable courtesy. Before settling on Neil Gorsuch as his SCOTUS Nominee he wanted to nominate former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani but had to be talked out of it by his aids. In the chapter on CPAC Wolff says there was a joint appearance on stage by Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon Priebus wearing makeup looked like a mannequin and Bannon sans makeup looked like a Country Music Star he was Johnny Cash (Why are you insulting the late Great Johnny Cash who was anything but a Conservative.  Throughout Steve Bannon was looking for a 50 year reign of the alt. Right . When Syria launched a chemical attack against itâ€™s people many children were killed Trump seeking advice hoe to respond was advised by Steve Bannon to stay out of it as itâ€™s not our fight. Jared and Ivanka sought a more forceful response Trump had  launched Tomahawk Missiles.

Wolfâ€™s sentence structure is downright torturous at times making the reading painful.  I was hoping for a more engaging narrative style in the literary journalism style backed up by real scenes and dialogue, but found most of the content simply supposition.  Supposition or gossipy stories isnâ€™t necessarily untrue.  After all, itâ€™s what probably draws most people to the book, including me.  But I was hoping for a better journalistic approach that would lead the reader to his own conclusions about this disastrous presidency.  Had Trump and Sanders not made such a public fuss about the book, even going so far as to trying to stop its publication, it probably wouldnâ€™t have stayed in the spotlight for so long.",February-25-2018,3
1119,Most of what Wolff wrote sounded so true that one didn't need to be at WH to know it.  Wolff's writing is witty.  Good fact telling.  The book confirms what most Americans already suspected from the very beginning and now know about Trump.  He never wanted to be President.

The reason is the current occupant of the Oval Office Donald John Trump!. Real estate billionaire, business mogul and host of The Apprentice television series this ill prepared, profane, misogynist bully is now the Chief Executive of the most powerful nation in the history of the world!  Michael Wolff is an investigative report who spent several months in the White House interviewing those closest to the Donald. His face has been plastered all across the spectrum of cable news making the hearts of those executives at MSNB and CNN smile with joy. Despite this media blitz and the tabloid odor of the book I did something radical-I read the book! What did I a political junkie discover and learn!1. The book reveals Trump as a classic narcissist who does not read or make wise decisions. He often acts like a child with accompanying tantrums and is quick on the draw to fire people who do not coddle him or his opinions.2. The Trump White House is a bullring in which such bullies as Steve Bannon of Breibart right wing media fame did battle with the president's daughter and insider Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner.3. Trump has not got a clue on how to conduct American foreign policy. He does not like his Secretary of State oilman Rex Tillerson.4. Trump got rid of Sean Spicer his press secretary and fired Reince Priebus former RNC chair and for a few months his chief of staff. General John Kelly the current chief of staff has difficulty dealing with Trump.5. Trump is very weak on civil rights for all Americans. His father had ties with the KKK6. Trump fired James Comey the FBI chief and is heavily implicated in the collusion scandal with the Russian government. He may well face impeachment in the future.7. Trump does not work well with Jeff Session the US attorney general who recused himself in the Russian intelligence probe.8. Trump fears what may be revealed in the Robert Mueller investigation of the Russian affair.9. Trump and his advisors did not think he would defeat Hillary Clinton and win election. The administration appears to be clueless on how to operate a vast federal government.10. Trump does not understand how the US Congress functions. His relationship with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have been rocky to say the least.11. Trump falsely accused the Obama administration of wire tapping his campaign.12. Trump has a short attention span and often repeats himself in conversation.  The book is well written and is much better than I thought it would be. Steve Bannon emerges from these pages as Trump's nemesis and the man who leads the charge against Ivanka and Jared with their moderate views about issues. Overall it is worth a read. Who know how much is true or not? The book will stir your mind and get you thinking about how the United States is being governed in this perilous time.

If you don't see the truth, then you clearly have your head in the sand.  I did enjoy it from the standpoint that it gave a full timeline, thus far, of the events that have unfolded since Trump took office.  I can't really watch any of it on open media bc I have a child in my house and really don't want him exposed to what might be the topic of discussion on our president of the United States.

1138,"Very entertaining (and quite concerning too).Short basic summary of Fire and Fury.-Trump and team had not planned for the eventuality of actually winning the election. The Russia investigation is partially a result of that as they were not careful.- In the White House Trump has struggled big time with direction. He was/is being pulled into 3 different main directions:-Bannon, alt-right where his heart seems to be in most issues. Global, liberal, corporate Jarvanka. Traditional Republican Ryan, Priebus etc.-He is extremely difficult to work with and is very moody and capricious. He can call someone great or humiliate them. You never know. The only person who gets along with him is Hope Hicks who doesn't challenge him. All his life has been spent in Trump tower with subordinates giving orders.-Bannon and Jarvanka hated each other and leaked stuff about each other out to the press. Bannon and many others considered Jarvanka to be out of touch with reality, entitled, inexperienced and thinking the White House was the Trump House and that they should go home.-Jarvanka thought Bannon was dragging Trump to the far right and destroying his Presidency.- The dysfunctionality in the WH with different factions/agendas vying for Trump's attention, a President obsessed with the press and with little interest in the vast majority of issues making random decisions depending on mood or faction influence at each point in time is the underlying theme of the whole book.- A lot of the tweets and comments have been just what we thought, Trump improvisations sending his aides into panic mode.",January-13-2018,5
1139,"Well written informative book that unfortunately confirms why we have seen and still see the day to day chaos from the White House.

1143,"Sure itâ€™s catnip for my liberal sensibilities and it probably plays fast and loose with the details, but it actually makes the calamities coming out of this administration make some kind of sense. Itâ€™s a simultaneously horrifying and infinitely entertaining romp through the train wreck that is the Trump presidency. I actually read the majority of it aloud to my wife so she wouldnâ€™t miss it. My voice is shot, but it was worth it!I highly recommend it for anyone interested in some of the mechanics and power dynamics of the administration and why it so often seemed (and still seems) to be so comically dysfunctional. Of course it really all comes back to The Donald, who whose utter lack of discipline, knowledge and capability make this awful reality possible. But the other players at work, who effectively make the White House their playground of power struggles, also contribute a great deal to antics.The surprising thing is that Steve Bannon, however reprehensible his politics, often comes off looking like the one sane person in the building. He knows all of Trumpâ€™s failings and frequently calls them out, at least when Trump is not around. He knows that Trump is his own worst enemy and that his actions will lead to ruinous consequences, but quite often heâ€™s powerless to stop him, because Trump is well... Trump, and will not have his behaviors dictated to him, no matter how sage the advice might be.The times when weâ€™ve seen something incomprehensible happen and it looked like it was Trump alone behind it, but assumed that there was some greater plan by the administration at work, it really was just Trump. Often the White House staff were as horrified as the general populace, if not more so because they had to deal with the fallout. Heâ€™s always going with his instincts and said instincts are often the worst when it comes to functioning in a civil society, to say nothing of being an effective president.But I digress.

1147,"It really pulls you in and gives you the dirt. Wolff seems to despise most of the characters in this bizarre worrying tale but you really can't make the stuff up either. He has a clear respect for Bannon though he might disagree with his hard right nationalism. Trump seems to be led and swayed by those around him so easily. He very often has absolutely zero political acumen, other than his deal maker inclination to get some $$ out of any scenario especially those involving Mexico and China. The trouble is that Jarvanka are political hacks as well...",April-9-2018,5

1149,"Before this book, I was on the fence as to whether Trump was playing a complicated game in office or just an out-of-his-depth moron trying to tread water in the big league.This book pretty clearly demonstrates a President that doesn't want to be president, never wanted to be president, but who is trying to exploit the situation as best as his predatory capitalist little mind can before he is ousted.With any luck, he and his ilk will end up in orange jumpsuits to match his ""tan"" and serve as a warning to other reality TV star shysters who run for president as a PR stunt, using our democratic process as an advertising mechanism to sell books, steaks, water, and country club memberships to his tacky properties.",January-11-2018,5

1162,"All of the most salacious details have already been covered in the press, so this book basically becomes a soap opera about the characters in the Trump White House and their day-to-day follies. Some of it's entertaining, some very dull. Wolff's hyperpartisan tilt and vague sourcing diminish his credibility, and while much of what is revealed can be corroborated by what we already know about this President and his administration, it is difficult to know what to believe. It's also very apparent that much of the information he was fed came from Steve Bannon, as much of the book seems to be told from his perspective - it's been aptly referred to as Steve Bannon's ""What Happened.""",January-11-2018,4

Now he wants a 'liddle' parade of his own, no matter the waste of money.The one thing he is able to do, without near peer, is spend money.  What he doesn't seem to understand is that the USA cannot declare bankruptcy to get out of paying the bills like he did 5 or 6 times.  I'd like to see someone keep track of all he and  his family have cost the country with vacations, traveling, family protection, weekends away, etc.I guess no one told him that the presidency is NOT a part-time job.",February-11-2018,5

1173,"This is not, as Trump claims, Bannon's book about Trump.  It is Wolff's book about the entire administration.  Those of us who read and watch the news religiously already know the bottom line--that Trump is border-line illiterate, incompetent, emotionally damaged, vile, and a grave danger to the nation, and that the members of his administration all know this.  Still, an enjoyable read that will make you feel better to see that you are not the odd person out.",January-7-2018,5

1179,"Behind the scenes scoop of the goings in the Trump circus tent has left me wondering why we needed this perspective. The mainstream news has been bringing us accounts of WH leakers since day one. The biggest surprise to me was learning that Jared and Ivanka Kushner are actually Democrats. But, the couple of times I came across the word pubic when it should have been public began to distract from the story. Helpful tip: keep your dictionary close by.",February-21-2018,3
1180,Wolffâ€™s description of chaos and confusion at the White House is definitely plausible. And readableâ€”held my interest. But the book needed an editor. Errors and typos muddy the authorâ€™s message and allow his critics to claim none of the book is true.,January-22-2018,3
1181,I think this is a wonderful insight to a man who is so unqualified and unstable that it baffles me how teh American public could fal for his salesmanship. He is a total loony and I only hope he gets removed from office before he drags the world into situations that will take years to unravel.The book itself is well written and could be confusing at times but overall a very good read.,March-13-2018,4

I weighed both sides before casting and found outside of Trump's easily researchable lies I couldn't get past the other character flaws to vote him in office. This book confirmed what I already knew and quite a lot I suspected. This is a must read.,March-1-2018,5
1184,"Interesting read.  While he acknowledges taking some liberties with his writing, the fact that nobody mentioned in the book has refuted his words,(except the orange dope) tells me itâ€™s true.",April-20-2018,5

1186,"There was very little in here I hadn't already heard.  (Any active liberal on FB hears the stories). Just the details around the events, but boring.  To me, a Democrat and vehement anti-Trumper, squabbling between right-wingers is mind numbing.  To me, everything they say or do is despicable, so what does it matter if they fight among themselves? I'm probably the wrong person to rate this.  After finishing it, I donated it to the local library.",February-21-2018,3

But there is no way that anyone could read this book and still have any illusions that anything good might come out of Trumpâ€™s time in office... Hence the need to portray it as â€˜fake newsâ€™.There are some mistakes and arguably errors of analysis and judgment but I believe the overall picture painted by this book will remain as a truthful portrayal of Trump and his administration down the ages...",January-11-2018,5

1195,"Unbelievably true - everything fits with what we watched unfold on the news.  How is this person still a sitting president?

Should be accompanied by personal research and additional reading on the part of readers.",January-31-2018,3
1198,"I got the Kindle version of this book right after its release because I didn't want to wait 2 weeks for the back order.  It was pretty much exactly what I expected.  It  further exposes the man who sits in the highest office in our land as a buffoon who stumbled into the White House despite his best efforts to fail.  Starting the book is like eating the first bite of popcorn.  It's satisfying and you want more.  As the book goes on, you start to get full and finally after finishing a little over half the bucket you start getting a bit nauseous.  That's exactly how I felt.  I devoured the first half of this book with ever mounting outrage but I reached a saturation point.  By two-thirds of the way through the book, it just becomes so disgusting and disturbing that I found it hard to continue.  This man is our president, our representative of America to the world.  He is not only racist and misogynistic, but he is also a complete buffoon.  Not even his own children respect him.  It made me sick to know that it's not as bad as I had feared, it's worse.  The book is well written and certainly something that will be eye opening but if you tend toward pessimistic views, you may find yourself becoming depressed and despondent after reading it  Come on America!  We are better than this idiot.  Read the book, get informed and take action.",January-17-2018,4
1199,"Like everyone else, I rushed to buy the book on release day only to find out that it was backordered to eternity.  So I went ahead and got the Kindle edition to read on my computer.  Now that I've finished, It is very much what I expected.  Lots of focus has been on the validity and though I am pretty sure there was plenty of hyperbole, the basic facts line up with reporting done by major newspapers throughout the Trump presidency and revelations in the days since publications have led me to assume that it is true at least to the spirit of what happened.  If truth be told these sorts of books often lean on interpretation and memory, but get the general hard truths correct.  And Wolff definitely does.I took one star because in the actual writing, I felt like Wolff would at times throw out lofty phrases or words to make himself sound far more educated than he needed.  An editor should have suggested  restraint there.  I don't know if he felt that it would somehow paint Trump's inability to coherently speak seem more stark, but all it really did was point out a level of condescension that didn't need to be there.I know full well this is a polarizing work and that people will have strong reactions one way or another.  Personally, nothing in it felt particularly shocking and if anything leaned further into things I already knew.  The best use for this book was to refresh myself on the last two years of life with Trump and what that has meant.For that alone it was worth the read.",January-8-2018,4
1200,"We purchased this for my mother-in-law.  She enjoyed it, but promptly began regaling my wife with stories about ""how things are REALLY run at the White House.""That is... concerning, given the sources and the timing behind it.  I can trust very little that comes from the White House these days...I imagine you will enjoy it too, just remember to take it all with a very minute grain of salt.",March-16-2018,4
1201,Very entertaining and gives an insight to our President and his People. Some of it is down right scary! Our country is being run by a crooked five year old.,February-17-2018,4
1202,All I could say is God help our Country and our People. The book is well written .The Subject matter is very scary. Could be he wants us to have a Dictatorship instead of our current form of Government. Just food for thought.,April-23-2018,3
1203,"Liked the most: The data supporting the reality of the dysfunctional Trump White House.  Liked the least: Thank goodness I read the Kindle version so I could check vocabulary.  In many cases, the Kindle definitions did not fit contextually with the message the author was attempting to convey.  The use of superfluous (defined as ""more than required."")  vocabulary was overdone!  Apparently Mr. Wolf was more interested in impressing readers with his knowledge of the English language than of exposing the dysfunctionality of the Trump White House.  The overuse of superfluous vocabulary by any author detracts from the continuity of the message.  I've heard Michael Wolff interviewed on MSNBC; he did not use superfluous vocabulary during his interview.",January-28-2018,3
1204,"As a book, it's nothing to admire, but as a historical footnote, it may be worth owning. If Trump gets what he deserves, I will be proud to own a book that helped in some small way to remove that idiot from office. Kudos' to Wolff for stepping up.",March-21-2018,3
1205,"This book focuses on a very short period of time. You were there and you are familiar with the events that occurred.  This book gives the insight into what happened behind the scenes. For the most part, nothing is a surprise. In your back of your mind you knew the madness that was occurring. This book just confirms it.You really know things are screwed up when Steven Bannon turns out to be the smartest and sanest one in the room.",January-10-2018,5
1206,"This is an astonishing and thoroughly credible characterization of America under Trump.  The conclusion has to be that a democracy, any democracy is too fragile to cope with the insanity  that is Trump and Trumpism.  This is a further revelation that democracy was no match for Hitler or any of the Communist totalitarians.  What we are missing is a prescription for what a society must do to guard against the evils of Trump - and Hitler",March-7-2018,5
1207,The book is an interesting read and describes the chaotic White House with a clear and logical framework.,January-15-2018,5
1208,"Basically confirms everything you suspect about what goes on inside the Trump white house, but in brilliant colorful detail. The audiobook is especially good because the narrator, while stopping just shy of doing full-on impersonations of the people involved, does a great job of acting out the various direct quotes. It was particularly entertaining to hear the details of the in-fighting between Kushner/Ivanka and Bannon. Equal parts enlightening, entertaining, and depressing.",January-11-2018,5
1209,A riveting book about a current topic unraveling right before our eyes. Pull up a front row seat and be an eavesdropper.,March-1-2018,5
1210,"The book gives a significant and ultimately scary inside look at the Trump White House.  But the publisher did the author no service by rushing the book into production.  It seriously needed some heavy-duty editing.  The sentences are often as long-winded, wandering and confusing as the statements made by Trump himself.  The result is that it often leaves one confused, feeling the need to reread the last excerpt in an effort to interpret what was just said.  For that reason, the book - and the reader - would have benefited from some serious editing.  The insight the book gives into the Trump White House is indeed scary, but it would have been much more obvious if the book had been better written.",March-10-2018,3
1211,"Didnâ€™t learn anything about Trump that surprised me. Leaned a lot more about Bannon. Was amazed to see personal agenda and Survivor Island alliance dots connecting among â€œJarvankaâ€ù and Lewandowski, Miller and still one of my favorite Trump Admin bungles â€” the Mooch. Am grateful for McMaster, Kelly, and Mattis. Workout them, God help us all.",January-15-2018,4
1212,"In interviews with Wolf, everyone keep asking, ""how did you get your information?""  I found myself, while reading, asking the same question.  It's an interesting read.  Nothing really new or untold.  Naturally, it reads like a reality show.  Fun read.  Even laughable at times.",March-7-2018,4
1213,"A fascinating fly-on-the wall view of events we all saw covered in The New York Times and the Washington Post. We've all witnessed Trump's ill-informed, irrational,inconsistent, unprepared, petty, angry and vindictive, often unmoored behavior in the papers and on live on television. So there are no surprises here, and everything is entirely consistent with what we have all seen on embarrassing public display every day (and in the days since this book was published).  What this adds is the behind-the-scenes moments between the rival factions. The Bannon vs. ""Jarvanka"" (Bannon's derisive name for Jared and Ivanka) battles are especially interesting. As is Bannon's hubris right before his fall. Jared is more fleshed out  than the narrow cipher in the small suit (though there is is not much ""there"" there). Ivanka is just about what you'd expect---only somehow emptier and more conniving. Not many heroes here, of course. Just the inside view of opportunists (Pence, Cohen), vain people making the most of their 15-minutes (The Mooch) or previously respectable people (Gen. Kelly, Gen. McMaster) humiliating themselves trying to please a petulant child. And lots of lower level people running for cover. Much has been made (by critics) of the small errors in the book, but the scenes in the book are not at all surprising given what is on the public record. Trump-apologists claims that it is ""fiction"" is itself so obviously false that it's laughable. We've seen most of it, and we're seeing it happen before our eyes.  It's as readable as good fiction is, and  you only wish it were fiction.",January-12-2018,4
1214,"I read much about Trump and his antics, but this book exposed me to some things I hadn't read about before.  I thought it was excellent and have recommended it to some of my friends.  I think anyone who votes ought to be required to read this; however, it probably wouldn't change the minds of those who think Trump is wonderful.",February-11-2018,5
1215,"Unsurprising, yet enlightening description of life within the Trump White House. Sometimes frightening, often entertainig.

1217,"This wasn't the greatest book ever written.  It was a book I really wanted to read and, more importantly, it was believable and probably factual with a few flaws. It wasn't particularly well written and it seemed very repetitive, but Trump himself is very repetitive and not particularly well put together.  History will judge Trump and I imagine that judgement will be far worse than anything found in this book.  I would say this.  If you really like Trump you should read this book.  I don't know if your mind will change, but I hope so.",March-19-2018,3

Even though we know a lot of the events described, the author links them together with themes like Trump and his team did not expect to win the electionâ€”they were in it to promote their brand and make more moneyâ€”so methods and appropriateness of actions did not matter.

1235,"While some facts and timing of events have been disputed this book seems to give an accurate picture of the chaos within the Trump Administration.  While DJT said he would staff his administration with ""the very best people"" we see that their lack of experience and overall incompetence, not to mention the infighting, resulted in the worst White House operation in recent history.  Perhaps ever!  Since the book was published more and more members of his administration have left while the Special Council uncovers more evidence of criminal behavior.  The book is written in a fast moving narrative that never leaves the reader bored.

1240,"If only ten percent of attributed quotes in this book are accurately represented, it paints an incomprehensibly dysfunctional Trump White House. I canâ€™t say I enjoyed reading this book, for the implications therein are entirely too depressing. It is unfortunate that it will not serve as an eye-opener to Trump head-in-the-sand loyalists who, of course, will never read it. I would have given 5 stars were it not for the annoying grammatical errors.",January-12-2018,4
1241,An interesting perspective.  To a large it extent it confirmed what most people already new about Trump and how dysfunctional this White House truly is.  His lack of discipline and leadership coupled with little to no understanding of how governments function is astonishing.,March-13-2018,5
1242,"After all the hype I was concerned the book might be a letdown.  It wasn't!  I'm glad to hear from someone who was in the Whitehouse as an observer taking notes and talking to people, including Trump.  Thank you, Mr. Wolff, for writing this book.  It's an eyeopener!",February-5-2018,5
1243,"Ironically itâ€™s is a confirmation from the inside of the sickness we see from the outside.All the symptoms of  this diseased , dysfunctional, irrational , illiterate Whitehouse was evident from the outside. The stage 4 cancer like condition is clearly effecting the surrounding branches of our government. The daily doses of irrelevant tweets is only further evidence of a decline in the state of our union with no hope of remission. Barack and Michelle were a tough act to follow on so many levels but this Whitehouse has become The Greatest Show on Earth . There is no shortage of clowns, flying trapeze artists, animals and snake oil dealers! Actually it gives the circus a bad name.",January-10-2018,5
1244,"Those who want the real story - especially those who believe Trump's derisive cries of ""Fake News"" - should seek the truth by  1) simply watching what Trump does and says, and 2) reading this book. Wolff sat in the White House for the past year taking over 200 interviews. What writer has had better access than Wolff? Even those who read The Washington Post every day will find Wolff's exposition  fascinating and, as well, brilliantly engaging and written. Should you believe Wolff's account? I do, because so much of it overlaps with exactly what we all hear the President saying almost daily. I don't believe most news is fake (presidents are, however) but if you do, start by reading this book.",January-15-2018,5

1252,"The author seems at times to be making an attempt to lessen the perception of wrongdoing by suggesting that the trumps was naive in the affairs going on around them. And most likely  victims of the more sophisticated Russian players.  The implication that Donald Trump is an accidental President, never expected to be elected, never intended to be elected, but only to capitalize on the fame of running.  It hints that he is hugely unaware of his position,  and those around him are playing and positioning themselves to get their own agendas across.  I finished this book feeling like I was being led to believe that we have a petulant boy-king that just wants to be loved and is surrounded by all sorts of sycophants.  He doesn't mean all those bad things he says and do, he's just  a victim of a rigged system.",February-25-2018,3

1262,This book confirmed the problems one would expect to take place in a white house with an inexperienced president with no knowledge or expertise in politics. Governing is very different from corporations and many have speculated that the country should be run like a business. Here's the response to that thought.  What happened here is the inevitable outcome of trying to run a country like a family owned corporation.

1268,"This book paints a good picture of Trump's presidency...a train just went off the rails, over a 5 lane highway, and crashed into a building that exploded into flames and toppled over on a shopping mall.

1270,"When Trump won the election, I saw a meme of Kim Jong-Un that said â€œWhoâ€™s got the crazy leader now?â€ù Heâ€™s not only a perpetual spoiled rich boy playing a role in his own reality show, but a serious threat to the free world.  Thereâ€™s nothing earth shatteringly new, but to read about it all in the context of everyday life in OUR White House sickens me. As another reviewer aptly said, itâ€™s worth the $15 to send a message that free press is alive and well and still working in the U.S.  So buy, read, and review today and make this the bestseller of the century!",January-6-2018,5

1273,"If you do not follow the political scene or watch the news, you would think that this book must be complete work of fiction. Wolff gives the reader a picture of the White House in turmoil , fueled by egos,nepotism and a complete lack of control. His reporting has been right on; I only wished he offered any options that might give this â€œreality showâ€ù a happy ending!",March-1-2018,4
1274,"You may think you have heard it all or that there is nothing new here but seeing the first months of this administration from the ""inside"" is quite eye-opening.  The infighting, the chaos, the egos, the incompetence are all in view.  You can call it ""Fake News"" but you would be very wrong as most of these events were reported on in various print and on-line long before the book.",March-27-2018,5
1275,Want the lowdown on what this president and his cabinet are up to?? Then this is the book for you. The author sorts through the chaos and tells the American people the unabridged version of daily white house activities. A must read for everyone!!,February-21-2018,4
1276,A must read for anyone interested in USA politics and was probably more about the puppet master Bannon than Trump. The book did however have repetitive moments and periods of boredom. But in the end I despaired for the USA.,February-8-2018,3
1277,"This book clarifies for me what has been going on behind the scenes that is the mess that I am observing with the Trump administration. It's clear that he has no business being anywhere near our federal government.  Trump is clearly ignorant, unstable, totally self centered, not very smart, devoid of ideas, a bully, dangerous and a total embarrassment to America.  This book helped me understand and confirmed my observations over the past 18 painful and upsetting months",January-16-2018,5
1278,This read like a political thriller. Except that it corresponded to events the nation had just lived through. It was indeed a rollercoaster ride through the first months of the Trump administration - if it can be called that. Obviously Steve Bannon was the authorâ€™s main source. It left me in despair.,March-2-2018,5
1279,"Interesting and timely--a book for this particular time if you want to know the ground gossip in the current White House. I would not say that this is a classic for the ages, or that it should be taught in school.  It delivers what you'd expect.",March-7-2018,4

1281,Good look into the inner workings of America's most dysfunctional White House.,May-5-2018,4
1282,"The book offers little more than confirmation of behaviors and personalities of key players in the White House. I appreciated it was written above a 5th grade level, but found it to be needlessly wordy in many places just to prove it could be so. Layout of content and time frames is segmented and compartmentalized which results in rehashing the same events numerous times with few additional details added.",January-11-2018,3

1285,"It was an incredible look inside the chaos of a Reality TV Star's White House. At the same time, it was disheartening that Republicans feel so ingrained and tribal that they'll sit back while an entire branch of the government is destroyed with the incompetence of a day-trader who never wanted to be President.Putin got what he wanted. We've lost respect home and abroad.",March-8-2018,5

1292,Reads wonderfully. Very telling story about the worst mistake America has ever made...and America has made quite a few doozies.,January-24-2018,5
1293,Wow!!  Couldn't wait to get my hands on this book and it did not disappoint.  Well written.  Very engrossing read.  Should be required reading for all U.S. citizens. Engaging til the end.  But scary when I look back and remind myself that this is not a fictional tale.,January-9-2018,5
1294,"I liked the insights provided by the author into the world of Trump. The book had a number of interesting passages but after awhile, the narrative became boring and seemed to be just be repeating the same observations with different particular situations. I listened to the Audible book and the narrator was not that interesting to listen to, which also distracted from the content.  After reading this, I listened to Unbelievable by Katy Tur which provided related insights on the Trump campaign but in a more engaging way.",January-10-2018,4
1295,Very very interesting view of the people in the white house and how it all is managed or mismanaged.  These are a very scary group of people with no long term understanding of the world or of the constitution.  Trump is a huge embarrassment and laughing joke around the world.Thank you Michael.,February-8-2018,5
1296,"I thought it was a riveting read that tied all the pieces together.  And, while I've heard the stories that Michael Wolf has been known to shade the truth a bit, so much of it is already public knowledge.  Told in a fascinating way.  Fascinating, like a car wreck is fascinating -- you just cannot turn your eyes away.  I read the book in two days.  Also, as a result of this book, Bannon is being called before Congress to testify and has been issued a subpoena to go before Mueller.  If the book does nothing more than that, I'm happy.",January-18-2018,5
1297,most if it is anti-climactic since the media devoured it prior to my receipt it.  However it is a pretty good read and frightening at the same time. If you didnâ€™t pay attention to the media accounts of the book then you will find it interesting,February-13-2018,4
1298,Disliked the run-on sentence structure of the book. Appreciated the honesty and the insights into the chaos and the madness of people running our country.,February-22-2018,4
1299,WOW I am not sure how much is true but even if 1/2 true it shows a presidency of dunces and amateurs,February-14-2018,5
1300,This book answers a lot of questions that I had about why the White House seems unable to function at a basic level.,February-18-2018,5
1301,"Sadly, the book confirms your worst fears. On the plus side, though, it provides some insight into how the insanity of the last few years came into being.That Trump never expected, nor wanted, to win and was just campaigning to raise his brand image before he and Ailes launched a new cable news network makes total sense. That is something you could easily see someone as vane and narcissist as The Donald doing with his golden years. Running for office and serving the country, yeah, not so much.As to whether the book belongs in the fiction section as some suggest, my sense is that there likely has been some embellishment, but that the vast majority of the book is truthful. Plus, if it were just a bunch of lies, why would Trump have turned on his once senior political advisor with such speed and ferocity? The day before the book came out, Steve Bannon was the political genius responsible leading the political revolution that resulted in Trumpâ€™s election. The day after the book came out, he was derided as insane and called â€œsloppy Steveâ€ù by Trump. That pretty much says it all, right there.",January-13-2018,5
1302,nothing really new in the book if you watch the news and pay attention to whats going on. the book mostly just puts the names of the leakers that the people on tv wouldnt divulge  when they broadcast the insanity of the trump whitehouse.,March-5-2018,4
1303,This book tells the truth about the chaos in the Whit House during the trump administration.,March-3-2018,5
1304,"Although I had followed the daily drama of the presidential campaign throughout 2016, Trumpâ€™s victory, (oh, the agony of it all), the transition and transfer to the new administration (I miss you, President Obama!) in January, 2017, I learned a lot from this book.  It fills in a good deal of context (duh â€“ like itâ€™s supposed to) â€“ a lot of behind-the-scenes information that didnâ€™t make the news.  It truly is a page turner â€“ Moves along at a fast pace, and reads like a novel based on an historical event - political treachery / tragedy.  Most people are already familiar with the characters herein, so thereâ€™s no confusion about whoâ€™s who.  Itâ€™s quite an experience reading this:  One soon becomes immersed in the narrative about the people and events in the White House â€_ and the reader soon feels as if s(he) is part of the drama â€_ right there among the people about whom weâ€™ve read so much and found so often on our monitors and T.V. screens.  Having read it, I feel better informed about whatâ€™s happening in (and to) our country at the highest level of our government.  No wonder this book has become so hugely popular.  I highly recommend it to all.",January-19-2018,5
1305,"Other than the bombastic and egotistic need for the author to use abstract and archaic words to try to show his intellect I found the book riveting and couldn't put it down. Well worth the read if you ever had even a sniff of incompetency on the part of the current White House. If like most sensible people you knew this candidate, now president, was an imposter then your instincts will be proven correct.",February-5-2018,4

1307,"I did not think I would enjoy reading the book, but found it to be an easy and informative read.",February-24-2018,5
1308,Great book. And I think 95% of it is probably true.,February-9-2018,5
1309,Despite what the media has reported about this book it's more about Bannon than Trump. It details how chaotic the inner workings of the Trump administration have been. How in over his head the President is and how he is pretty much a puppet. A puppet being controlled by either Bannon or Javanka.,January-21-2018,5
1310,I am college educated and found the vocabulary a bit challenging at times. It feels like the author was trying to use vocabulary as validation for his statements. It was unnecessary! Otherwise I found it through and interesting.  If only 20% of it were true I would say that we have a real national crisis on our hands.,March-24-2018,4

1313,"I became uncomfortable with how much this book appeals to Bannon's narrative, but it appears he was one of the few interviewed who had any common sense (not withstanding his ethnocentric nationalist agenda). I appreciate the insight provided by the author attempting to understand what is happening inside the white house while interviewing a large cast of stupid people, evil people, and liars. While choking down this bold interpretation I would implore you to read between the lines and come to your own conclusions. This work will likely be the closest we will ever come to understanding the 'truth' of the first year inside this nightmare.",January-10-2018,5

1316,I have always thought Trump was a con man and a fraud this book confirmed it.,January-23-2018,5
1317,Many people may assume at first glance that this book is biased. I am here to tell you that it is not. The author truly took every person's view into account. Collecting arguments from every angle possible truly was the best way to tell the truth.,January-24-2018,5

1323,"It was an interesting read - probably most of it can be believed, but I found Michael Wolff''s writing style is hard to read.  When taking writing courses in school, I learned that ""run-on sentences"" were a no-no.  However, most of this book was written in this manner.  Frequently a whole paragraph was nothing but one long, badly constructed sentence, which had you confused before you finished the paragraph.  He also injected long, seldom used words (most likely to show how smart he is) when a more recognizable one or two would do. Luckily I was reading on my Kindle (with a readily available dictionary included).However, you do feel as if you're getting some ""insider"" info, so maybe it does clear up some details not in news accounts.",March-8-2018,3

1326,"Entertaining and sobering. Michael Wolff has opened a window into he Trump Presidency which will cause many to lose sleep and I don't just mean progressives. Trump's mercurial nature as illustrated in Wolff's book is on display as we endure the current government shutdown. Provoked, in no small part unquestionably by a president who can not allow a win-win negotiation but who sees every negotiation  one n which  ""I win"", ""you lose"". The DACA bi-partisan bill fell to this caprice as did the CR bill which Senator Schumer thought Trump had agreed to, but reneged upon. No president in history would have been able to survive one term with this type of arbitrariness. Unfortunately, the Republican Party, always more beholden to their benefactors rather than their constituents, has shown an ethical vacuity which has enabled this mess of an administration. Michael Wolff likely has surprised no-one (his own estimation) since we should have seen this coming. I will give it four stares rather than five due to editorial laxity (misspelling, errors in context, etc. )which show it was rushed to print. Although overall I highly recommend the book for an overview of the state of our politics today.",January-20-2018,4
1327,"An interesting and compelling book. Although much of what the author describes has been known about this President already - his short attention span, that he doesn't read, is not well-read, is not curious, is impulsive, etc.- this book gives background information about how and why these deficits and character flaws are impacting Trump's leadership and policy-making abilities. The information about Trump and his White House is scary as hell and we all should be paying very close attention to everything that's going on.",February-4-2018,5

1331,"Sadly, this confirms too much of our suspicions.  A timely book and one that hopefully will define a very brief moment in our country's history. A must read for anyone concerned about this present occupier of the White House.  God save us all.",March-5-2018,5

1336,"The book was almost a chatty version of day to day life as seen by the participants of a pre election campaign and then a chaotic Whitehouse in its early days. It shows people who came in with attitudes of ""deliberate change ahead"" but without any pre-planning of how to organize, staff and start the implementation.  It gives a scary indictment  of the results of the lack of vetting of nominees for the highest position in the western world and how a lack of understanding of history and intercountry relationships affect world behavior with or without leadership.",March-13-2018,4
1337,"I canâ€™t give a full review as I quit reading it half way through.  Not because it wasnâ€™t well written or informative.  But because we continue to live in the fire and fury of the Trump White House.  Maybe some day in the future I will be able to look back and try and make sense of it all.  Sadly, what I did read was not surprising.  I appreciate Michael Wolffâ€™s willingness to share.",March-13-2018,4

I believe a great portion of this book, but would temperate the outrageous antidotes, as somewhat moderately true  Time will tell what will happen to this presidency and our country.  And it is a frightening future I am afraid.  Yes I recommend this book. But I find Wolff,s writing style extremely difficult to read. Plus all his unnecessary and ridiculous over the top vocabulary.",February-25-2018,4
1340,"Don't really care for the authors writing style. Uses many, many big or unheard of words making it difficult to follow. I got half way thru and am now bored. A lot of hype, made him a lot of money, but the book ( what I read) was a disappointment",March-1-2018,2

1342,"Holy cow...how did we get here??? What a bunch of incompetent nuts. Ruthless for money and power but not enough political experience between them to find their way out of a paper bag. Think about your hairdresser complaining about how lazy airline pilots are and how she could fly a plane better if she put her mind to it. Then she tries. They are even too stupid and ego driven to know what they don't know. It's a page turner, and each day it gets proven more and more. God helps us. America the Beautiful has got to put her big girl panties on and kick some butt to get peace, order, and a future for the middle class back.",January-25-2018,5
1343,Most of the information is common knowledge if you listen to the news every day.  But there are some inner details that are not available to the public.  It confirms the fact that Trump is the worst corrupt president in history.,March-13-2018,5
1344,"I would like to believe I'm a rather educated man, however, Michael Wolff spent more time using ""big words"" to explain even the simplest of topics, than he did on the subject matter.  The story line was all over the place.  I would have enjoyed it more if the chapters were better transitioned.  The only positive outcome of reading this book is I learned the meaning of hundreds of words.  That being said there are also a few grammar and spelling errors in the book. (Note: I am not a Trump supporter, however, I am proud to be American and support democracy and our government)",February-4-2018,2

1349,"Wolff provides ecstatic amounts of firsthand anecdotal evidence to prove how historically insane the Trump White House truly is, which is surprisingly even more so than one could have imagined.However the book will likely do little to convince anyone of anything, as those who will be receptive to it already know Trump and his rise to our highest office is indicative of a fractured citizenry and a systematically brainwashed voting populace. Anyone who supports Trump will never read a word, or simply decry it as fake news.Wolff's writing style isn't the friendliest either, though he masterfully integrates dozens of players throughout this maze of a cluster**** which no modern director could reasonably portray on screen without generating millions of incredulous eyerolls.",March-27-2018,4

1352,The truth. Nothing else.,January-11-2018,5
1353,I read this from cover to cover in 2 days. It was a real eye opener. I liked that the author did state that some of it may have been opinion or that he could not authenticate some of the info. It made the person of Trump a little more human. Was not surprised by most. Made me feel bad for Melania. But Mr. Trump is NOT a nice man.,February-23-2018,5
1354,"Movie â€œ A Few good manâ€ùDo not read this book if you can not HANDLE THE TRUTH!Very well written and very informative.

It is called being PATRIOTIC, not PARTISAN",January-14-2018,5
1355,"I Just received it, after the waves of more and more news about it, I think it will be joyfully reading book.in fact the treatment of Donald Trump period is so complicated and so confusion in the same time, but it is so funny in reading.he came to the presidency by the American choice, and he will leave it by their desire!the American know him so much before his run to the elections, and they voting to him so clear, it is their business not more.the question is: why now they deny him!",February-4-2018,5

1357,"My intention was to read this book in one sitting on a lazy Saturday, but the information was so mind blowing that I had to take breaks to wrap my mind around what I had just read.  The book reinforced what has been plainly on display about this presidency, but added unknown background that explained the why's and how's. All I can say is that I will never take any political people at face value again, and I am praying for our country every day.",January-13-2018,5
1358,What can I say that hasn't been said on TV and talk radio? Fascinating and easy to read.,February-17-2018,5

1361,"MW writes almost as a fourth party member with his descriptions of the unorthodox forms of miss communications at the highest level of our government. When a person is elected as President he should have a sound basis for politics and how they operate in the US. When a businessman assumes s position with absolutely no political background then he is out of focus with his dealings as a President because as a businessman his primary purpose was to fix any problem he had with favors our payoff. I am reminded of past Republican Presidents, primarily, Richard Niacin and Ronald Reagan, and their inane positions. Nixon for Watergate and Reagan for the PATCO debacle. Nixon violated his oath of office. Reagan destroyed PATCO, six airlines, the airline unions. The President is not above the law and his job is to protect the people who asked for better working conditions. Trump has far exceeded the failures of these two presidents and like President Clinton should be held to the highest standard of his office......ER",January-26-2018,5
1362,"Couldn't put it down.  A spot on insider's look at the day to day operations of the most unique, and frightening presidency of our nation's entire history.When taken with currently known facts, and the President's recent live performance in the Cabinet room with Congressional representatives of both parties discussing DACA, it becomes clear that Michael Wolf's central premise is quite true.The book leaves us hoping for the inevitable showdown before Special Counsel Mueller to occur sooner, rather than later, for the safety of both our Democratic Republic, it's institutions, and the world as a whole.",January-11-2018,5
1363,The prologue sent me scrambling for the dictionary but then after that it was an easy read. My advice is skip the prologue and go right to the 1st chapter. A well written account of what is going on inside the White House.,March-15-2018,5
1364,Absolutely eye opening. Everyone regardless of their party affiliation should put this as their #1 book to read in 2018!  Certainly questioned me to look deeper into my ability to go beyound â€œhyperboleâ€ù!  This is a must read!,January-17-2018,5
1365,The Deplorables should read this. If you didn't think he was a narcissistic nut job you will be scared for our country being run by such an inept disorganized delusionist. Sad but Wolf could right another book on all the crimes committed since book release.,February-14-2018,5
1366,Michael Wolff you are my hero. !!!!!I wish I could have added my dirt on him to your  book. Just being a new yorker seeing him over the years operate. He knows the price of turning a man/woman to his ways. We grew up with this Confidence Man. He makes elmer gantry look innocent. Try reading Melville s book. From ace nyc,February-18-2018,5

1370,"The author uses too many ""BIG"" words. Not for a common dummy like myself. Luckily - I have a built-in dictionary on my Kindle - becauseI have to look up at least one or two (sometimes more) words on each and every page. I like the book - but would have enjoyed it more if hewould have written it with less ""BIG"" words. (Maybe it's just me - I'm not sure !!) I've read many books in my lifetime (75 years young), and neverhad to look up the definitions of so many words. Takes away from enjoying the book.",March-8-2018,3
1371,"Much like all of 2017, this book is both bananas and totally plausible. I know there is a lot of he said/he said right now in the news snd for all I know Michael Wolff is a total snake. But the truth is that sometimes you need a snake to catch a snake.",January-7-2018,5
1372,"I'm a liberal and I was fascinated by this account of the inner workings of the Trump White House. However, it was like reading a high school student's collage essay where the student attempts to use every obscure word in their vocabulary, often incorrectly I might add, in attempt to sound intelligent. As Stephen King once wrote, ""any word you have to hunt for in a thesaurus is the wrong word. There are no exceptions to this rule"". Every few pages of Wolff's intellectual exercise contains an obscure term, used incorrectly, and it greatly detracted from the reading experience.",February-25-2018,3
1373,"On point, this describes the background noise as we have been witnessing the volatile first year of this unstable presidency.",January-7-2018,5
1374,"In spite of the dangerous, inept, and clearly unfit man we have in office, I have to admit that I enjoyed this book and even laughed out loud at times. Unlike some other reviewers, I had no problem with the author's style and I kind of enjoyed the asides he frequently inserts into his sentences. As for the accuracy of the book, anyone who has paid attention for the past year has already witnessed so much bizarre behavior by this White House that it's not even remotely a stretch to believe the anecdotes in Wolff's book. Is this a great book? Probably not. I gave it five stars because it is an important one, and a book that should be read by everyone who cares about the survival of our democracy.",January-11-2018,5
1375,In reading this book the supposedly salacious is woven in so smoothly as to feel totally true and real because I'm sure it IS! A GREAT and compelling read. Thanks Mr. Wolff for a brave wonderful book.,January-28-2018,5
1376,"I've been consuming the news coming from this White House avidly.  Fire and Fury provides a good synopsis of the Trump presidency.  It's helped me to better understand relationships among the players and rationales that I hadn't fully appreciated.It cements the argument that this White House is in a constant state of turmoil with a grossly incompetent president at the helm.I highly recommend this book for any thinking person, who wants a better understanding of this unfortunate mess.",January-15-2018,5
1377,"I thought it was bad, but now it's truly scary.No one seems to be in charge, the leader of the free World is a shyster/ex-reality star who thought running for President was a win, because he was certain he had no chance of winning, but in his mind, it was a win for the Trump brand and name, even when ( and he expected to) lose.Who thinks like that?His supporters will call this ""fake news, fake story "".I'm not so sure.He's totally unqualified, he really has no qualified advisors, and even if he did, he doesn't care or listen to them.I pre-ordered this, and when it came out early,Amazon worked with me to get it the minute it came out.I read it in a day.I'm just stunned as to how bad it really is.",January-10-2018,5
1378,"Could not give it a five, only because the writing was wordy, or written in a hurry? Great read, though:) Actually, a lot of it makes complete sense, especially when you consider all that is happening as we speak. Can you say dysFUNCtional? Yup.",April-22-2018,4
1379,"Possibly without sufficient proofs, but stunning inside revelations keep you flipping the page as fast as you can. A sequel perhaps?",March-2-2018,5
1380,"A few interesting tidbits about what Wolff claims is going on in the White House but nothing that makes me believe he really knows much.  It's a lot of hype in my opinion.  You can tell the book was hastily written and definitely needs a good edit which makes it a difficult read.  The problem is mostly in how much is really true vs. speculation.  For me, it wasn't worth the money.",March-13-2018,3
1381,"The audible copy is an easy listening at nearly 12 hrs. This is an inside look at the chaotic white house. On top of that Donald Trump wanted to ban this book which means a lot of the information is real. It is what we already know about Trump. He's nothing more than a narcisstic conman with the help of the media attracted 63 million republican voters with his rhetoric on bigotry, racism, and deceit. Hopefully America (if we survive) comes out of this stronger and better.",January-6-2018,5
1382,"Preordered and arrived earlier than the anticipated date.  Book itself can be read by randomly selecting chapters or front to back.  It is entertaining, amusing ... and frightening. Passed along to a friend when finished.",March-9-2018,5
1383,"I purchased â€œFire and Furyâ€ù out of pique that a president would attempt to squelch publication of a potentially unflattering book. Unflattering, yes; newsworthy, questionable. Not much new, verifiable information is here.  It is a collection of anecdotes viewed through a gossip filter. More than a story about Trump, it posits that Bannon is the more extreme and scary figure.  The pre-publication excerpts were cherry-picked to elicit headlines.  Still, the larger picture of ongoing chaos and infighting is believable.  I would still like to see a list of the alleged â€œmistakesâ€ù and the authorâ€™s rebuttals.",January-28-2018,3
1384,"The author writes clearly about a muddled topic. It is both an easy read and quite frustrating.Honestly, I only bought it because Trump was so adamant that no one should. And now, I'm appalled.",April-26-2018,5
1385,"Very good read and revealing.  Still only 4 stars because, well, 5 to me is exceptional.  But, the only thing wrong is that it still does not address the thing (whatever it is) that is the genius of this moron.",March-12-2018,4
1386,"I'm a librarian and, while all my fact-checking came through with this title, the writing is not as polished as I expected. I'm a New York Times and Washington Post reader so I was expecting that level of craftsmanship.",March-8-2018,3
1387,Interesting and an easy read. Left a rather scary overall impression of Trump as very easily led and manipulated by others.,January-10-2018,5

1389,Great book!! It really shows how are going through the Worst presidency in our history.,February-1-2018,5
1390,"I only gave it 3 stars because it is important to have books that challenge those in power. That said, there was very little in the book that I didn't already know from news articles and television coverage of the White House. The writing style was not particularly dynamic, and appeared poorly edited and proofread. I felt as if they publishers had rushed it to market without thoroughly editing. But I am glad to have it just so that all the information is in one place. And people who have not followed the Trump regime as closely as I have will find it informative up to a point.",March-9-2018,3
1391,"Quick read and very entertaining,  Chaos in the Capitol is the main point.. I hope anyone reading this book will vote to keep Trump to one term or less..",February-5-2018,5
1392,This was a good book. I would recommend it to all people who are interested in politics. It gave me insight into the White house.,January-13-2018,5
1393,"Michael Wolff did a great job writing this book. Every single day with Trump has been a daily poop show from the world's biggest hypocrite. I watched him on the campaign and I was counting the days until we no longer had to look at or listen to this jerk. The book lays out the nightmare in the White House quite well.  Our country is being  held hostage by a non-stop lying con-artist who is in no way qualified to be a town mayor, never mind President of the United States. The damage he is doing to our country will take years to fix after this incompetent cheat.  Michael Wolff did a good job of portraying what we have already been hearing in bits and pieces. This is the tip of the iceberg compared to what we will eventually learn from Special Counsel Bob Mueller. I have little doubt that he will expose years of illegal money laundering by Trump and evidence that Russia helped put this gross incompetent in our White House. I got this book from Amazon and I highly recommend giving it a read.",January-19-2018,5
1394,"This book was difficult to put down, wondering what was next to be revealed. I only wish the narrative had continued through a few more months. It won't change any minds about one's opinion of the White House turmoil.",March-13-2018,5
1395,"Everything you thought was going on with these lunatics, and then some. It isn't Hunter Thompson's ""Fear and Loathing,"" but it certainly made it obvious how incompetent these people are.",February-3-2018,5
1396,"The author, Michael Wolff writes an easy-to-read, understandable narrative and he is credible. While what the actions of the chief character in the book seem more like absurd fiction, Wolff's research, personal experience and reporting tell me it's not: it's real! While the situation in today's White House is sad for our American democracy and it's hard to read about it, every citizen of this country needs to the read this book..",March-14-2018,5
1397,The author provided many details behind what I read/heard from the mainstream media.  He also confirmed some of my suspicions about the current administration in the White House.,February-20-2018,5

1399,Well...well....well. No surprises here. Those who voted for Trump knew exactly what they were getting. Those of us who didn't..... we also knew exactly what we were getting. What a sh*t-storm. Most entertaining account of the Bannon and the Jarvanka angle - who knew those kids were in over their heads? (Pretty much everyone except them.) Absolutely NO ONE with a brain will find this enlightening in any way - you will not be surprised at the chaos that is the Trump Presidency. The in-fighting is the best. Schadenfreude at it's finest. Great book - it confirmed my worst fears.Will happily watch them all go down in the 2018 midterms.,February-2-2018,5
1400,"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White HouseNothing new to add to the review. I bought the hard-back even though I'd already gotten it for my wife on Kindle, just to thumb my nose at the concept of saying you can't publish something in a free country. That probably did more for the book sales than any publicity campaign could do.The writing is not all that good IMHO, I haven't gotten past the third chapter in over a month...",February-27-2018,5
1401,"Wolff handles the scandalous and gossipy content of the book well, but it could have used some additional proofreading. Minor typographical and even minor spelling errors are common. Still worth reading, though.",January-6-2018,4
1402,"I wanted to love this book. However, it feels much like a tabloid, is not objective, and I wonder how much of it is actually true. It was fun to read the juicy bits and I enjoyed contributing to the millions of books sold.",February-13-2018,3
1403,"Good read. A real page turner, hard to put down. Well-written for the most part, a few editing errors, probably due to the rush to publish. It won't surprise anybody who has been paying attention to the non-Fox, non-Breitbart news. Having said that, it is amazing how little support Trump has within his administration. Even his family are not always his friends. I'm sure there are relatively minor factual errors, but on the whole, it agrees with everything I have read and heard about the dumpster fire that is the Trump administration. May God, in whatever form he or she exists, have mercy on us all.",January-15-2018,5
1404,Great book that every decent American who's concerned about the future direction of this country should read and think about. Highly recommended! Really appreciated the efforts of the author to expose the ugly truth of this presidency.,January-12-2018,5
1405,Poorly edited but gives a chronological timeline and an inside look into the most dysfunctional White House ever. It reads pretty much like the news everyday. One mismanaged disaster and treasonous act after another.,March-10-2018,5
1406,"It was funny. It doesn't seem far from the mark in regards to Trump's very public persona. Not really a well written book, but it was entertaining in this year and a half of doom, gloom, and political induced national paranoia.",March-14-2018,3
1407,"The further you get into this book, the more convinced you become that the author really has an insight into the Trump White House.  I'm left with the question of just how did my fellow citizens allow this to happen?  A must read.",March-7-2018,5
1408,Great book. Well written. Extensively researched and absolutely believable. I wanted the book to keep going â€”especially into the Russian investigation and whatâ€™s really happening in the White House.

1409,"I loved the narration, and am sure to read over again in print! Superior reporting and delivery..I believed every word of it.This country's in serious trouble because most people already knew this was happening already! Where is the 25th amendment? I just read the book by 28 psychiatrists! How long do we have to suffer this fool! Need to IMPEACH!DELIVER US FROM TRUMP!  Genius...hahahahaha",January-8-2018,5

1418,Get this book. Weather you like him or not this book tells you about the real man. I think that after you read this you are going to say why did I votefor this guy. And why is he still in charge of my country.,February-27-2018,5
1419,Recap of events. Interesting descriptions of the Trump family members and what other staffers think of them. The ambitions  of them and the lack of insight and abilities is amazing. Recommend reading for all â€œTrumpersâ€ù.,January-7-2018,4
1420,"Great read. It's catching a lot of heat from the right for being too harsh, but honestly, the author does a great job of taking rather scathing quotes from Trump's inner circle, and spinning them into the best possible narrative for Trump. I think it's fair. If anything, the left should probably be mad it isn't more outrageous. Really it just reads like the daily articles you see on the White House, and kind of just confirms... it's an ugly time to be involved in American politics.",January-10-2018,5
1421,"An interesting read and descriptions of staff fears ring true as well of those of the informed public. how actual fact based the information is remains a question in my mind ,even though I have no doubt that the current administration is both an embarrassment and danger to the America we believed we were.",January-14-2018,3

1423,"I have enjoyed reading this book, and I donâ€™t read books.  It is well written, easy to see and read.  Most importantly, it is believable.  The book is concerning because it is so much worse than is being reported.",March-9-2018,5
1424,"This book only confirms my thoughts about Donald Trump in the White House. To me it is clear he is a loose canon in the Oval Office. It is also clear that Trump's claims of genius are seriously out of line. The book is well written and straight forward. Of course, in books of this type it often has a hidden agenda but I saw no reason to doubt based on Trump's daily behavior.",March-8-2018,4
1425,"And I bought it at smile.amazon.com which means a donation goes to The Nature Conservancy. Take that Trump! There's human interest, strong evidence of dementia and/or insanity, and maybe even a few new tidbits for Mueller to follow up on.

1430,"Doesnâ€™t really tell us much that couldnâ€™t be gleaned from the continuous press coverage of the fiasco that is the Trump presidency but the bits of new information that are there are worth waiting for. The overall style, as a condensed read covering the first nine months or so of Trumpâ€™s only term, is very entertaining but the writing is quite painfully convoluted with endless recursive digressions which make reading the text something of a chore. Worth struggling through for the fun revelations.",April-7-2018,3

The obvious main source for this book is Steve Bannon, so read his passages with a  grain of salt.  However, it still shows how fortunate we all are that the chaos of the current West Wing has prevented all of the factions at play here, including Bannon's, from doing far, far more harm.",April-3-2018,5
1433,"Well written expose on the behind the scenes fiasco going on in the White House.  Particularly liked the battle between Democrat Jarvanka, Establishment Priebus and Alt right Bannon.",January-18-2018,5
1434,"I bought this book because President Trump wanted it banned.  Of course, it became an instant best seller.  It was interesting enough for me to finish but it was not very well written.  In addition, the author did not back up a lot of his claims with sources.  Worth purchasing simply to defend the First Amendment.",March-14-2018,3

1442,"To be honest, I havenâ€™t read Fire & Fury yet. I bought it as a way to irritate Trump since he attempted to block its publication. Itâ€™s my way of giving him the middle finger. He doesnâ€™t get to decide what can & can not be published. Iâ€™ll get around to reading it after Iâ€™ve significantly reduced my already extensive TBR pile.",March-8-2018,5
1443,The stories are good/bad/sad entertaining but shameful that this is what the presidency has become. The reason for only 3-stars is because there are too many typos and grammatical errors for such a well-know journalist that's it's very off putting to read.,February-24-2018,3
1444,This book was worth every penny I paid and even more.  Well written and revealed what most Americans already believe.  Trump and his minions aren't draining the swamp.  They are creating a bigger and more deadly swamp.,January-31-2018,5

1453,"Clearly shows the Trump is not capable of effectively governing our country.  It also calls into question any one who supports him.  His vision, and the vision of Bannon, is clearly not the type of America envisioned by our forefathers, no matter how much they want to lay claim to a monopoly on patriotism.",March-11-2018,5

1457,"Granted, there is new information in Wolff's book.  However, I am finding it more like reading a text book with a rehashing of the past year's most unfortunate events in the White House.  I am distracted by sentences/statements that begin with the word ""which"".  Grammatical errors  drive me nuts, especially when they're supposedly edited by educated people.  What is going on?!  While I'm being picky, the book itself appears to contain second rate paper quality with poor assembly.  In spite of my negatives, however, I am thankful it was published and American still has free press!",January-15-2018,3
1458,"I was very surprised at how well written this book is, given the circus atmosphere surrounding its release.  The author is meticulous in detailing the  inside  activities of this WH.

1462,"1,  I enjoyed reading the book because it reinforced much of my thinking and opinions about FnM.2.  I particularly liked the first 100 pages because the author filled me in on a lot of background that was missing previously.3.  I was/am particularly appalled at the gutter language of today's political leaders in their everyday interaction with each other. No wonder our vocabulary has become so diminished from the past.4. Along these same lines, the author seems to be having to prove his ability to rise above the norm with his opinions that include complex words with meanings only found by combing the dictionary.5. The middle 100 pages were worth reading in order to develop a picture of the characters and their WH setting and interaction... Not boring but a little slanted toward character assassination by the author..6. The last 100+ pages brought me up-to-date, again because I am open to it, and gives me talking points for table discussion. The filthy language of Bannon is particularly disturbing and gets in the way of my own clarity of thiought.7. I have recommended this book to many others  on both sides of the aisle to read for issue clarity.Thank YOU, Michael Wolff for this singular timely piece of work & Mcmillan Corp for publishing it with immediate grace.Love CHILDREN with a ZERO Footprint, Mr. Ed",January-23-2018,4
1463,The book gave great insights into the behind the scene maneuvers of the people in the Whit House. Explained the background that led to many of the hiring and firing of various. Revealed who the leakers really are and that no one expected Trump to win. Showed that Trump is a puppet whose strings are pulled by various people. Great read. All I expected plus some!,January-16-2018,5
1464,"This book exposes the ignorance, hubris & undisciplined chaos that was Trumpâ€™s campaign & now - administration. Confirming Trump had no idea people wld take his over-the-top rhetoric seriously enough to actually elect him president. Trump & staff were so naÃ¯ve Putin easily used them as pawns; unknowingly colluding w/Russia to achieve Putinâ€™s goal of disrupting our election & preventing the qualified, savvy, intelligent candidate from becoming president. Implicating themselves in obstruction of justice & acts of treason, along the way. Even if investigation is allowed to complete, Republicans will never hold Trump accountable. They care only about party/power not country. Americans hv become characters in â€˜Animal Farmâ€™. Wolff opened my eyes to the systemic corruption that is our government. Basically, Trump has given the mega wealthy & himself carte blanche to milk as much profit as possible from America & bend its people to their will. To hell w/individual rights, the environment, integrity & principles. Wolff has exposed more than Trumpâ€™s ineptness.",January-7-2018,5

1478,Bullying people and trying to interfere with free speech is not acceptable in this country. Demanding loyalty and never ending praise is only for the truly inadequate and insecure.  Threatening to sue or lock up anyone who opposes you does not yield obedience. I can recommend several places where this behavior IS acceptable. Those places might also welcome another golden tower. Worth my $14 to make these points.It is absolutely clear to me that the there is a lot of truth in this book. You just canâ€™t make this stuff up. And the lack of pushback from those quoted in the book only adds to the credibility.,January-6-2018,5

1480,"This was an interesting book, but I quickly got the impression that it was written in haste and that greater care could have been taken in utilization of sources.

They ran in the same circles in New York. Attended the same cocktail parties and rubbed elbows with all the same people. When the president found out who was writing this story, he was relieved and let his guard down.  The author was given total & complete access. Loved what he uncovered.",February-5-2018,5

I believe the author was trying to be creative and to written a book to ""sell"" his idea that he knew what people in the white house were actually thinking. I do not believe Trump was the right choice, but found this book to be hard to believed.",March-4-2018,2

1493,"Some of the arguments that are presented as fact are obviously no more than speculation or opinion, but the overall picture of the west wing parallels everyday news of dysfunction, narcissism, and incompetence.

1497,"Just started the book, but I'm really loving it. Almost everything Trump says is provably bogus, and what he said about this book is at the head of the list of things he's wrong about: It is definitely NOT boring! Probably only half of it is true, but I don't care and it doesn't matter which half. Regard it as entertainment, not documentation, and you won't be disappointed.",January-7-2018,5

Edit: The hardcover book, 1 day later, is now OOS and now takes 2-4 weeks to ship from Amazon.Drumpfs 'cease and desist' letter and threats of lawsuits prompted an early release of all versions of this book.  Thank you publishers for responding to the threats in the smartest way possible.  You couldn't have capitalized on the news and fervor and momentum of this book any better.  It is #1 on Amazon today.  This book is literally 'flying off the bookshelves.'

Basically, if you been reading headlines and stories, and watching any of the 24 hour news networks (Excluding Fox) then youâ€™re probably familiar with much of what the book dives into..  Thatâ€™s not saying it still would not be an interesting read, as you do get some more interesting background information regarding some of these stories youâ€™re already familiar with .. For those that have not been engaged much, itâ€™s a must read!  After reading this book the entire weekend and finishing it midday yesterday, Iâ€™m still left with the same question I had.. How did we let this happen?!?  How are so many people gullible enough to vote for Trump? Trump is nothing more than a sideshow carnival barker, a used car salesman.. Yet he had, and still does have a base that refuses to acknowledge reality.. Unshaken support from a base that refuses to see him for what he is..",January-8-2018,5

Wow I see why Donald Trump was not happy about this book being published!  I think it is a must for the American people to read about Trump and the things that are going on with this President!!!

We all know who the guy is, and his cabinet is as much a mess as he is, for the same reason - they are all unqualified to be doing what they have taken on, from the top down.

1533,"Well written except for a few dangling typos and word omissions, no doubt a result of rush to publication in maximum exploitation of opportunity. Peppered with savvy references to events in the worlds of business, entertainment, and politics as well as a moderate variety of obscure words to enrich one's vocabulary. Wolff does a great job of describing how the White House has become a Nut House. His writing style is enjoyable, often humorous enough to promote laughter when tears might otherwise be appropriate. Favorite chapter: #19, especially description of the Bannon-Hicks encounter near its end.",January-8-2018,5

1541,My question is how did we allow ourselves to get here? The author makes some excellent points.  A reader should be appalled by the actions of the parties.

This glimpse of the first year of DJT's presidency is absolute madness, at one point I thought I was reading fiction but no, if all these facts are true I really can't fathom how these people are running the country.

1557,"I felt the book was good at coalescing data points which many of us may have heard briefly but due to the rapid pace of news events within the administration, it is hard to focus and digest material.

1565,This is an ok read. No real big surprise that I found. I was hoping for so real insight but it was mostly recounting the year. It does explain some of the nonsense weâ€™ve been putting up with but not so much as to give us hope it will be over soon. I did find that the book had a big emphasis on Steve Bannon since he was the source of most of the information.,January-18-2018,3
1566,I purchased the kindle version of this book because I couldnâ€™t stomach the thought of having a book with Trumps face on it in my home.

1581,"While there are some minor errors, overall the book is very well-documented and quotes conversations and statements made by White House insiders, including Bannon, Walsh, Kushner, Ivanka, Powell, Cohn, Priebus and others.  Much of the new material simply confirms much of the chaos and insanity we've heard from Trump directly, either in his off-script ramblings or puddle-of-consciousness Tweets. Of course, if you're part of the ""base"" or if you get your news from Hannity or Limbaugh, etc., you will be directed by your Obergruppenfeuhrers to decry the book.

1588,"Wolff has written an extraordinary, sober and surprisingly balanced account of what happens when the most powerful office in the country accidentally falls into the hands of a group of political neophytes, led by a charismatic con artist with limited intelligence and an exaggerated case of advanced attention deficit disorder complicated by dyslexia and near total ignorance of history. As one of the participants notes: â€œYou couldnâ€™t make this sh-t up!â€ù Steve Bannon emerges as the twisted Machiavellian tragicomic protagonist, able to to grasp the madness that surrounds him, but incapable of using it to his advantage. He is finally brought down by his own megalomaniac fantasies, imagining himself as a future presidential candidate collecting and mobilizing the alt-right rejects that form Trumpâ€™s core support.  Despite the criticism that Wolff (as garnered from Trump supporters, this book is well worth reading. History will no doubt produce more detailed and accurate accounts of the minutia, but for a first read, this is a page-turner, that would be hysterically funny if the consequences were not so severe.",January-25-2018,5

1594,"Really scary that someone as insipid, vapid, and moronic as Trump is is our President.  Very hard to put down full of great anecdotes and leaks.  Not really smmoth or crafty writing, but the inside information makes up for that.",January-24-2018,4

1603,"Take with a grain of salt, reading between just enough truths.  Funny, if it there wasn't JUST enough truth in it.  Scary when you understand that the underlying truth is Trump CRAVES attention.  Good or bad, doesn't matter.  Attention is attention.  I've said that from moment he ran.  Now someone take his damn Twitter account away.",January-20-2018,4
1604,"I read historical bio's all the time.  And this one was good.  But, when you remember this is current, your extremely startled.  Rather than reflect on the presidency of Trump, you can't help reflect on the people who put him there and the party that accepted him.It helped me to think deeper as to where the Trump family is coming from;  Lofty clouds that don't allow them to understand the majority of American's at all.  Does the president's daughter think this is her charity work?I've often felt ""other"" presidents were just puppets on a string, but this one, IS.  If you can get ahold of his strings and keep them.  Bannon really thought he had his man, and the book leaves you thinking he still does and is waiting for the day.Just waiting for limited internet, mass deportations and martial law.",January-20-2018,5

1608,What can I say! Everyone should read it and then weep. Courageous work by the author. It turned into the most sought after book on earth for a while. Another thing brought to us by our current pResident's antics.,March-20-2018,5
1609,It is a frightening look at the dysfunction of our government and those in office. Very good book!,January-10-2018,5

1617,"I love this book.  We all like to read, watch and listen to things that confirm our own opinions.  This certainly proved to me that everything I thought about the current administration is absolutely true.  I canâ€™t put the book  down but at the same time I donâ€™t want to end.

1621,I wouldnâ€™t have rushed to buy this had 45 not threatened the publisher. Iâ€™m making a sincere effort to understand the guy and his supporters and learn how to communicate respectfully. This book is helpful because there is some balanceâ€”Wolff doesnâ€™t completely let liberals off the hook and I have the impression of better understanding the forces at play. Plus itâ€™s a fun read.,January-18-2018,5
1622,"This book is less about reporting new things that haven't been previously touched on by the press, but about bringing it all together in a ?cohesive? picture (not sure that is an appropriate word to associate with the Trump White House!  The exception might be that it provided new insights into the mind of Steve Bannon -- we all had a pretty good idea of him based on the available material, but this book filled in some gaps concerning his pervasive influence on the way things were going in the White House.  I found the ""Artful Menace"" description of him to be well supported in the book.My hope our President and his Family will use the images in this book as a basis for self-examination and as a catalyst for their change of behavior.

Itâ€™s very well written and offers a very fascinating glimpse into just how much of an organizational mess his first year has been.

1633,"PHEN. OM. EN. AL.  What a read!  This is exactly what I thought it would be and more.  I only put it down to write this review.  The book takes you step by step, from campaign into the White House.  Lots and lots of quotes in the book to tell the story.  Definitely recommend this one.  Easy to see why the people who support Trump want to deny itâ€™s validity and truthfulness before theyâ€™ve even read it.  Although itâ€™s flattering to some who surrounded Trump, it is definitely not, for Trump.  I have new found respect for some of the people he surrounded himself with, but for others, not so much, and definitely not for â€œthe Donaldâ€ù.  Twenty stars for this book.",January-5-2018,5

But overall a revealing read that does help explain some of the chaos that is still going on to this day.  i.e. Tillerson out for saying Russia was involved in the attempted murder of a former citizen on foreign soil when our Supreme Leader did not want to mention his buddy Vlad, kinda thing.  The book does shine some insight, and pity for the staff.  The Left will love it and the Right will call it Fiction.  What else do you expect.",March-15-2018,3

Bannon is an egomaniac who, like Trump, canâ€™t keep his mouth shut. The guy wants war with China. Has he ever been there? And, the competing interests, power grabs, and wanton tarnishing of career bureaucrats and opportunists is fascinating to see. What a train wreck.",January-13-2018,4

1689,"NINE THINGS ABOUT THE BOOK â€œFIRE AND FURYâ€ù1. This book does not pretend to be a biography or documentary. Itâ€™s an interpretation by one man of the things he has seen and heard during his extraordinary access to the workings of the Trump White House. For those hoping to see Trumpâ€™s presidency crash and burn, the book gives a lot of hope. For those who support Trump, the book has enough inaccuracies that they can dismiss the whole thing.2. While a lot has been made in the media of certain excerpts from the book, thatâ€™s really not what the book is about.3. The book is sort of a recounting of the â€œgreatest hitsâ€ù of Trumpâ€™s first nine months in office. People who follow the news and pundits carefully will not learn a lot of new information.4. The pull of this book that it provides context for many of the seemingly random events and soap-opera revelations of Trumpâ€™s extraordinary presidency. In this, the book provides a lot of insight that, in the words of many in Washington, D.C., â€œrings trueâ€ù5. The main thesis of the book is that Trump is so ignorant and insecure (and maybe mentally unsound), that three separate inner circles formed in the White House, each trying to control Trump - and discredit the other two. As part of doing that, the book reveals who many of the leakers in the White House are (spoiler alert: everybody).6. The book paints a picture of government in which decisions are made at the highest levels, not for the good of the country, but to serve the goals of the decision-makers. Sometimes itâ€™s ego, sometimes money, sometimes revenge.7. One of the most fascinating threads throughout the book is the role of media; both their power to spin stories, and their vulnerability to being spun by their sources.8. The writing style itself is weird and uneven. Sometimes Wolff uses vulgar language. In other places he uses esoteric vocabulary words that nobody ever says, such as â€œrevanchismâ€ù, â€œmyrmidonsâ€ù and â€œloucheâ€ù.9. This book is a relatively fast read. If you donâ€™t follow politics, the parade of names, agendas, and counter-agendas can get confusing. But if you are someone who finds it valuable to understand the current culture, this should be required reading. Even if you donâ€™t agree with it.",January-7-2018,4
1690,"This book provides fascinating insight into the Trump White House. Although the administration labeled this book ""total lies"" and ""grotesque,"" it obviously believed the quotes from Bannon, which make up a good deal of the book. While much has been made of gramatical errors or getting a few names wrong, the author had access to the White House (Gorka recently confirmed this in a Tweet, Bannon has not denied his quotes, etc) and people talked to him. A lot. The backstory on who was leaking what to negatively impact their perceived enemies/competition put last year's unprecedented number of leaks into perspective. Bannon was the one who leaked that Kushner asked the Russians for a back channel!?!? Not the ""deep state""? Wow. And little is made of the president's alleged lack of ""mental capacity"" in this book (it is only mentioned near the end), so that point was blown up by the media. After reading what a disaster the White House staff is, one can only logically question the president's ability to manage and think through serious issues beyond what impact his actions will have on the media as part of his grand show.",January-15-2018,4

He madly rode the birther controversy, fabricating claims his investigators were digging up details that would be supportive of birther claims.  He challenged the academic credentials of an articulate, Harvard educated law graduate, who handled public abuse with restraint and dignity through 8 years of his Presidency.The book successfully paints Trump as the ignoramus I would have never thought him to be.

And when it is stolen to be used as political ammunition against our American citizens and country, we have to take a stand against it.2. I do not support any American President who encourages any organization to steal from American citizens and use the stolen information to embarrass, harass, or demean my fellow Americans. It weakens our country. We are the UNITED States, remember Mr. President?3. I support American consumerism.4. I support any American citizen who writes a book about our American President and Government, regardless of whether or not I agree with their views and/or opinions. Why? Because it's our right to speak out against our government without repercussion.5. I do not support any government, including our own, who tries to stop a publication because they don't like what it says. If it is libel, then sue. Otherwise, in America we have the right to publish a book without government interference.So this morning I exercised my right and bought an ebook and hardcover version.

1707,"Michael Wolfâ€™s Fire and Fury is a new entry in one of my favorite genreâ€™s â€” presidential insider history.  This book has received a lot of attention because of its controversial account of the 45th presidentâ€™s first months in office.  Wolffâ€™s book is based on interviews he has had with key officials in the administration.  As with all insider books of this type, direct attributions cannot happen because insiders canâ€™t risk their careers by speaking openly about what they see happening in a presidency.  Bob Woodward, the master of this genre, wrote extensively about the insider view of both Bushes presidencies as well as Bill Clintonâ€™s.  If one looks at press reports throughout the last two years, one would find that what Wolff highlights was reported in part at the times the events took place.  The difference is that Wolff now adds more details and background to events he mentions.  His book shows the intense internal rivalries that have existed in this administration.  Rival factions have engaged in backstabbing, leaking stories to the press to discredit rivals, and outright sabotage to endanger the actions of the opposition.  What appears at this point to be the dominant faction, which he calls Jarvanka, is centered around Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.  Another was centered around the now ousted Reince Priebus, and another centered around also ousted Steve Bannon.  Bannon in particular appears to have spoken directly at length with Wolff, in part because of his intense hatred of Jarvanka and their cronies.  Priebus and his group was the first faction vanquished largely at Jarvankaâ€™s behest.  Wolff appears to give heavy weight to Bannon, which in my view is a major failing in a reporterâ€™s objectivity in this book.  Bannon is not a clairvoyant muse of our times, despite how Wolff attributes to Bannonâ€™s prognostications.  I would have preferred to have seen more of a balanced view from the Jarvanka faction, but their voice is less evident in this book, perhaps because as they are the dominant insiders who have nothing to gain by speaking out.  This failing aside however, itâ€™s hard to deny the intense dysfunction of this administration, something which Wolff shows throughout the book.  So much so that I was fatigued by bookâ€™s end by the depth of ineptitude and bitterness that pervades among the Presidentâ€™s own team.  It will be interesting to see how the years ahead will shape as this administration matures and begins to understand (or not) the power their presidency has.",January-31-2018,4

1710,"When I just gave Fire and Fury a 5-star rating, ""I love it"" appeared next to my cursor.  I did NOT love it.  Don't get me wrong, this book is well-written, captivating, and ""I can't put it down"" awesome, but I did not love reading about the chaos, stupidity, selfish decisions, bickering, and ignorance within the White House.  I want to live in a well-run country, with a leader who speaks thoughtfully, and who acts in the best interests of our nation, and who has a moral conscience, and who isn't allergic to reading and thinking and waiting before speaking.  Right now, the White House is a mess, but I am not telling you anything that you don't already know.  If you're reading my book review and trying to decide if you should buy this book, then let me tell you why I bought it.  Trump tried to keep me from getting access to it.  He tried to ban it.  Or, at least, his lawyers started the process.  So, I did what anyone would do.  I went online and, just like a few of the other buyers who left their comments, I bought the book.Wolff inserts a lot of his opinion into the story line, explaining people's intentions (based on their actions).  You might not agree with his conclusions all the time, but remember that he was there, hearing the talk, seeing the reactions.  And he talked to lots of people, and listened.  Give him an ear, if you're a pro-Trump American.  Just listen to what a man who was in the thick of it all has to say.  Listen.If you voted for him, well I am sorry, but Trump is a failure.  He is.  I found it difficult reading about so many failures, from a man who boasts about his ability to get things done.  It is obvious that he doesn't understand people, and doesn't know how to get people to support his ideas.  Sadly, you may, like me, come to realize that he has few ideas of his own, and those he has are surface-level and temporary.Still, after all is said and done, I am just shocked that America chose Trump to be the President.  I voted against him, but all the votes in my state went to him anyways.  I was outnumbered.  Well, America.  You got what you voted for (or didn't vote for).  So, deal with it.  Fix the problem and stop trying to repair his every day, needless, self-induced pain.  What a moron!",January-15-2018,5

1733,"Book is a rush job and needs an editor to smooth out the choppy prose. Author recycles his descriptives, such as ""peculiar,"" but then that's just the adjective I'd use to both describe Trump's through-the-looking-glass presidency and this book covering its first year.  What phrase comes to mind throughout the read is: 'important if true.' If author Wolff isn't making up any of his claims, and every anecdote and event described in the work is based on fact, then Fire and Fury is a truly staggering and possibly important chronicle of the ad hoc (at best) inner workings of the office of our current Commander in Chief.The author is most convincing in the scathing characterization of President Trump: he is child-like, narcissistic, petty, ego-maniacal, allergic to reality, semi-illiterate, vindictive. A man who surrounds himself with care-taking women and yes-men factotums. Who determines his friends based on their obeisance and pandering and his enemies based on whim.  Who has no game plan, no concrete objectives, and no real desire to lead.I sometimes laughed out loud at the absurdities contained on just about every page, thinking I was reading sharply-observed, if sometimes a bit purple, political parody,  and wondered if perhaps I was dreaming I was watching a sequel to the movie ""Idiocracy,"" but then I had to remind myself I was wide awake and reading about the current (non-fictional) state of the American presidency.  And the book belonged squarely, then, in the horror genre.The author likens Trump's candidacy to the Broadway play ""The Producers,"" in that Trump planned on running and losing simply to augment his brand. Which makes sense. He never planned on winning and neither did his staff. And everyone in his inner circle was as horrified as the American â€”and globalâ€”majority when Trump secured the office. This book lays out all the reasons why everyone should be very afraid.",January-7-2018,4

1744,"This is the best comedy/horror book since ""Feud,"" which was an absolutely DELECTABLE trashy tome about Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in their declining years. Unfortunately for Donald Trump, this book exposes him as an even bigger drama queen than either of them, and his declining years seem to have begun when he was a toddler.Every word in this book has the ring of truth to it. Every outrageous, unbelievable word.The President is the biggest narcissist ever in the history of reality. I was not surprised by a single nightmarish thing I read. In fact, I honestly don't think I could have imagined worse than what's told in this book.Buffoon. Idiot. Bully. Tool. Blowhard. Blimp. Gasbag . Liar. Pretender. Poseur. Hack. Charlatan. Cheater. Bigot. Misogynist. Pervert. Clown. Every word, every action from this man is so clearly directed at his father, in an unconscious, perpetual attempt to win the approval he feels was so coldly and permanently denied as a child. It's tragic, really. But what's more tragic is that the Republican party allowed this man to become their mascot. The books tells of slimy GOP toadies and users and sleazy sycophants galore among the White House staff, including the family. The tales told of these people's actions-and also their treatment by their ""Boss""- are devastating and humiliating, cringe-worthy and always completely embarrassing. I mean, Trump will consume himself eventually, but how will the party ever come back from this?????Wolff's book clearly shows how the President is emblematic of everything that is wrong with this country: he's reckless, wasteful, indifferent to human suffering, self-important, self-destructive and just-plain destructive in general, cares more about money than humanity and is utterly ignorant of how the rest of the world perceives America. This book's existence is proof that, thankfully, the good people of this country will not permit him and his ilk to destroy or sully this great nation.. America didn't need to be ""made great"" until this administration took over. Making America great AGAIN will now be up to the Democrats and Independents so that America can return to being the dignified, wise, respectable, compassionate, considerate and cooperative land of brotherly love and opportunity she truly is.The deplorables have all been outed now. Scurrying back under their rocks when Trump is impeached will be very hard. The Nazis had a tough time trying to go into hiding by assimilating themselves back into the populace. The Trumpsters will face the same fate.""Fire and Fury"" is a great book. It gives first-hand and irrefutable evidence that Trump's own fate is already as clear as can be: he will never be able to cope with his dismal, utter and complete failure as President of United States of America.And that is as it should be.",February-7-2018,5

1747,Insightful and witty. An alarming glimpse into what we all basically knew was happening inside the White House. I wish the book could continue through to the end of the presidency.,January-13-2018,5
1748,"Hooo boy...it certainly was pretty entertaining. It's just what it says on the tin--an account of the first 9 months of Trump's time in office, along with a description of his campaign leading up to his victory. To keep this review short, much of it is unbelievable, and I'd take it with many grains of salt. I hardly think Wolff was a fly on the wall for big scenes like various heated arguments between team members (Bannon's terrifying blowup at Hope Hicks the most dramatic) and things like that.However, there are a couple of things that make me think the core of the book and its theses (that Trump's team is fractious, fundamentally unprepared for the responsibility of rule, and didn't even want to win at all) are accurate. First, it's the reactions of the Trump administration itself. As I'm sure many of you have heard, they didn't deny the most explosive allegations the book made against Bannon, they just threw him under the bus. Why'd they do that unless those allegations couldn't be denied--i.e were true? Second, it's that the book doesn't come across as just an entirely one-sided, calumnious attack on the Trumps and everyone related to them. Wolff makes no secret of his contempt for these people, but also assiduously mentions what few good traits they have. He compliments Bannon for reading a lot, describes the cunning way in which the ""Jarvanka"" faction managed to outmaneuver him, lauds Jared and Ivanka for being moderating forces even as he condemns their financial stupidity, and admits that Trump, despite being a philandering misogynist, at least keeps Melania ""in the style she's accustomed."" So the fact that there's some balance here lends Wolff a little more credibility than I'd otherwise give.And even if it was totally incredible, the book would be fun enough to make it worth the price. Again, Wolff makes no secret about his contempt for the Trump campaign, but he's not preachy about it. With clear, easily understandable prose, he highlights their absurdities and failings in a vivid, engaging manner that allows the reader to really see how bumbling, incompetent, and occasionally crazy these people are without adding in too much of his own voice. It's hard not to laugh at some of the descriptions of Bannon's poor choices in clothing, Trump's perpetual confusion, and Jarvanka's manipulations. Even if some of it might be embellished or just untrue, it's very funny.Still, humor alone can't carry a ""serious"" book. If this work might not be 100% accurate, what value does it have? I can think of a couple:1: As a demonstration of what people think of Trump's presidency. Again, even given all the caveats of its accuracy mentioned above, many people--not just me--think there's something to its outlandish accusations. If nothing else, that should give you an idea of how polarizing Trump's administration has been, and how profoundly cynical the opposition has become concerning Trump's sanity and competency.2: A telling snapshot of the divisions within the Trump camp. Whether or not the specifics are accurate, I think it's hard to deny that Wolff fairly captures the genuine loathing many in the Trump campaign feel for each other. Pretty much everyone has heard of the conflicts, both personal and ideological, between people like Jared Kushner and Steven Bannon, John Kelly and Anthony Scaramucci, the ""Republican Establishment"" and the alt-right populists. Wolff's book provides excellent dialogue and ""fight choreography"" of a sort to put all that strange infighting on a very memorable stage.So, yeah. I can safely recommend this book, and say I certainly don't feel like I wasted my money. Check it out, if only to get a better understanding of our current historical moment by keeping an eye on what you're skeptical about and what you find yourself drawn to believing. One more thing, the Kindle version does seem to have a couple of minor errors, like on page 4, there's a line that says, ""This was the job Bannon a week later""--missing word, it should be ""Bannon *received* a week later."" I think I noticed a couple other small errors like that too, and while they're not huge, it is a little irritating. Still worth a buy though.",January-11-2018,4
1749,Excellent read! Seems to captureThe chaos and rival factions perfectly. The attempt to stop publication was the reason I felt compelled to buy it immediately but I enjoyed reading this and feel it is likely pretty accurate depiction of events and in fighting plaguing this administration.,January-9-2018,5
1750,Well written and assembled. Provides a lot of context to the people surrounding the president.,January-18-2018,5
1751,"After Trumpâ€™s successful, though inadvertent promotional efforts I was as little able to resist the lure of this book as millions of others. Asked in an interview Michael Wolff (the author) said he was surprised by the bookâ€™s big success (and I donâ€™t think he was dissembling), because most of the things he writes about were actually known before, I think it is to his credit that he provides sort of a unifying narrative for the chaos that has reigned in the White House ever since this adminstration set foot in it, showing that it is partly due to all the different factions that were (or still are) after their own advantage, not thinking of, and much less working for, the president, the administration as a whole, or God forbid, the people they are supposed to represent and serve. It seems to most closely align with Platoâ€™s regime of oligarchy, except Trump displays neither temperance nor moderation.There have been critics who thought to attack the book on the grounds that it contained factual errors, sources have come forward claiming they never said what Wolff attributed to them or at least not in the way he worded it and others tried to discredit the book by saying Wolff himself admits that not everything is true which is not all what Wolff said. In the note preceeding the actual text he explains how he was able to install himself in the White House and also that, depending on whom he spoke to, he offen received very differing accounts of events and then had to try to make out what most likely really happened. So is every word he writes true? Probably not! Is the account he provides as accurate and faithful as he was able to manage from his perspective? I believe so! His characterizations of the different protagonists are spot on and chime with how they have portrayed themselves to the public, with what they have said or written on other media and how they have acted when in the public eye. In fact, even if Wolff had written the whole book as a roman Ã  clef, the protagonists would still be recognizable.On the surface it is a very entertaining read, because the author has a captivating and slightly ironic ""voice"". On the whole this book reads as ""Realsatire"" (a German term for which there is no adequat translation in English), which is when reality manages to eclipse its own satire. In a way it is also frightening and sad because what also emerges is that Trump may be Trump, but he is not really the agent of this story. Nowhere does this become more obvious than in the healthcare discussion. From Trumpâ€™s public statements about the topic it has become quite clear that he knows nothing of healthcare. In a pivotal moment Wolff reports that in a discussion with his aides Trump guilelessly asked ""Why canâ€™t Medicare simply cover everybody?"", a question that is also asked by many progressives. But of course that is not what the Republicans (or even establishment Democrats) wanted, so this heresy never reached the light of the day, though it might be Trumpâ€™s most intelligent utterance ever (he probably wasnâ€™t aware of the import of his question). What this episode shows is that Trump is not so much the problem himself, but rather a reflection of the people who continue to support him (some against their better judgement) and making excuses for his unconscionable behavior, the people who voted for him and still believe him (reportedly still more than one third of all Americans) and the society and culture which made his presidency possible in the first place. A very sobering and disheartening conclusion to arrive at. So maybe the book isnâ€™t a satire after all, but more of a farcical dystopia in which we are all caught and from which there is no escape...",January-18-2018,4

As a graduate student I read A LOT, too much non-fiction, so wasnâ€™t all that excited about reading this book over my winter break. Have to say that I am pleasantly surprised that it reads more like a crime novel and is filled with compelling stories and facts unknown to me. Honestly, I am eating it up because it is filling in the gaps and helps me understand how we got into this WAKING NIGHTMARE.The vocabulary may make it difficult for some in â€œthe baseâ€ù to fully appreciate and understand but there is enough substance to engage them if they chose to pick up the book and face the truth. As has been said in other reviews, if just 10% of this book is true OH MY GOD! For those claiming this book is poorly written I call foul! This is very well written and compelling. His writing style is engaging and I find it difficult to put down. What I love most is the feeling of being a fly on the wall in some very sensitive and intimate conversations.

Thus doubling as an historical reference of where these people came from, how they became associated with Trump, and why (or if) they influenced him, I found ""Fire and Fury"" to be mesmerizingly educational, and I highly recommend it, even to Trump supporters.",January-21-2018,5

I'm not a voracious reader so this book probably wouldn't have been on my radar at all except for the tantrums coming from the WH and its lawyers about it.Fair disclosure: I don't like Donald Trump and never have.  Being a NYC resident I had a very low opinion of him back in the 80s, long before he decided to play president. Nothing in the book is a revelation for me.  So far, no smoking guns that paint him any worse than the opinion I've always had for him and his administration of toadies.  The author has taken a lot of hits from Trump supporters, some of them well-deserved.  I would have liked to see more research and verification. Back during Watergate, Ben Bradlee insisted that Woodward & Bernstein get at least one corroborating source for any claim made by them. Sadly, that's missing here.  Then again, my existing opinion of Trump based on 30+ years experience with his grandstanding and string of failures provides a backstop for some of it.Wolff's book is an easy read, like a long Page Six story with about the same depth. Wolff put everything on the line here. He's probably burned his journalistic future with this book.  No one is going to trust his off-the-record assurances from now on. Wolff did to his sources what Trump did to scores of millions of Americans: he scammed them. He didn't play nice or by the rules.  Tyrants don't either.",January-6-2018,5

The forefathers, having lived under the Kings rule, set up checks and balances to prevent a President from having complete power. Most Corporate CEO's can not grasp that concept. Corporate America is not set up to protect the greater good and the individual member.Mr. Wolff gave us a clear look into the mind of Mr. Trump.

They believe that their roles are to garner the most attention, help shake up the legislative branch, and to protect and gloss over the persona of Donald Trump.Mr. Wolff has shown us the underbellies of the senior staff. Their fears, insecurities, and how they cope with their nightmares. Its not pretty, nor is it smart. They underestimate those that fail to appreciate their beliefs and standards.

1842,"Bought the hardback, planning to loan it to my sister & B-in-L who'd received a Christmas gift Kindel with the book on it.  OK, the content won't be a huge shock to anybody following the news, BUT you'll never watch cable news in the same way.  And I'd recommend you not watch any cable news while reading the book.  It would just be total overload.  Not sure which ""parts"" are supposedly total lies since everything I read was pretty much substantiated, either exactly or by logical connection.  If you're a strong ""English/lit"" major, tho, some of the writing could drive you up the wall.  There were no editor acknowledgments and, believe me, THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN EDITOR.  Wolff needs a storng review on the use of who vs whom and, particularly, the unacceptability of separation in compound/complex verbs.  I found myself mentally rewriting -after re reading to make sure I understood what he was trying to say - MAJOR portions of the book, particularly in the last half.  But nothing in the book is going to come as a major shock to anybody who has been keeping us on the news or who has any awareness of Trump prior to the Presidential election.  And, contrary to what some might expect, it is NOT a ""go easy on Bannon"" book.  He, along with pretty much everybody else in that ""swamp"" we call Washington, D.C., comes in for a well-deserved serving of ""lumps.""  If the ""fake"" news hadn't already started scaring me, this book would fix things.  Somebody needs to ""drain the swamp,"" but I don't think one of the biggest ""rats"" around is the best ""drainer.""",January-29-2018,4
1843,"Reading Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House is useful. Yes, you already know a lot of the incidents from daily news. No, White House senior advisor Stephen Miller, it's not ""a pile of trash, through and through."" Yes, no matter your viewpoint, you will find something to argue with, something lacking. No, Washington Post writer Alyssa Rosenberg, it's not dull (though her point is right that some claims could be developed rather than just asserted and left there on the page).The book is an overview, fly-on-the-wall from Michael Wolff's hanging out at and doggedly reporting on the White House in the first year of Donald Trump's U.S. presidential administration. Trump didn't expect to win, didn't really want to, didn't and doesn't know what to do as U.S. President. He was ripe for Steve Bannon's prepared alt-right plan. The president and presidential staff, lightly familiar or wholly unacquainted with the rudiments of government and political operations, defaulted to warring among themselves for position. Steve Bannon today (1/10/2018) left far-right Breitbart News after being fired from his White House post in August 2017; his critical comments about Trump and his family in Fire and Fury caused him to be pushed out of Breitbart.Will the book provide insights to help us, directly or indirectly, to right the foundering ship of state that America is today since the presidential campaign and election of Donald Trump 2016? What do you think?",January-9-2018,4
1844,Awesome book. 100% recommend.,January-27-2018,5
1845,"We've seen many of these anecdotes and met many of these 'characters' (they're real people but feel like fictional characters in some unbelievable made-for TV movie) in the nightly news. The value of the book is that it provides a chronology and context that builds to where we are today. We need something to organize the facts, fake news and alternative facts that come at us daily from all directions.As many have said, this is a messy book that could have been better edited, and that attempts to combine the 200+ plus the author interviewed into a fair and accurate narrative. But we needed a book like this now to put some structure to the competing voices from TV news, Twitter and the social media comments from each other as we look forward to where the Trump administration is leading us. The timing of this book is incredible, because of the inexplicable access given to Wolff.It always strikes/scares me how close we are to the edge of chaos. Get a flood in Houston, for example, and there's no gas in Dallas for 2 weeks. What this book proves is how close we are to chaos with this man as President. How can someone with no respect and literally almost no friends get elected President! Hopefully this book--and the more organized realization of the danger of where we are--will help us back away from the edge and get things back to normal for everyone.",January-5-2018,4

1854,"Just finished ""Fire and Fury"" by Michael Wolff.  At several points along the way, I thought to myself how much I wished this book had been illustrated, either by a graphic house like DC Comics or by a capable courtroom sketch artist.  Nonetheless, I thought it was dutiful with regard to the mesh of the narrative with the time stamps of that which is already in the public domain.  By the end, I was left wanting more.  Unfortunately, ""more"" is evolving at this very moment. (Sigh)",January-10-2018,4

But, I loved the book; I could not stop reading it. Everyone should read it. I am so sad that I am not trained to look for the meaning behind the obvious words and actions that politicians speak and do. But, Mr. Wolff will help people  to learn to inquire further than we have ever done. The book is as exciting as the best thriller. The problem: No one will  talk to Mr. Wolff again:  how will he write volume 2?

Thank goodness for this book - we might have laughed all the way to Trumpist authoritarianism, but the reveals in this book may help bring on the blue wave in 2018. Hopefully.

I highly recommend Fire and Fury to everyone who is devastated by the Trump win and/or who enjoys interesting writing. I will definitely read more Michael Wolff.",March-8-2018,5

Great job by Wolff and much respect for his reporting, but itâ€™s disheartening to read about the unrelenting incompetence of MOTUS (Moron) and the damage he is causing our country. 2.

But I appreciate reading about the inside machinations of this Trump White House and Wolff does a good job telling the tale.

1874,"This book is funny, well written and gossipy. It is also terrifying. Is it impeccable journalism? No. Do I believe much of it? Yes. Michael Wolff got a front row seat to Trump's first year in office (albeit sneakily) due, in part, to incompetence and chaos surrounding the Whitehouse since the inauguration. Though this mess has been an open secret, this book fills in the details and rounds out the characters of Trump's ever changing inner circle, their dynamics and the lack of disciple and strategy that currently define the office of the president of the United States. Some observations need to be taken with a grain of salt, but what is abundantly clear is Wolff's compelling portrait of a man who is vindictive, clueless, narcissistic and quite possibly a lunatic.",January-5-2018,4

1876,"Love the book and all that it's accomplishing, which is a lot. But since the book doesn't need any further praise from me -- it's getting a lot of deserved praise all over -- I'll say this, with the delusion that maybe Michael will see this and fix the book in the next edition. :-)I use the device of 'parenthetical dashes' a great deal myself. But, seeing the effect that they have when they're overused -- which Michael absolutely does, and like I'm doing here -- I might have to make myself stop. I think if not for the extreme interest of this book's material, all the dashing would doom the book to tedium. Dashes like these can serve good purposes -- like providing further depth, and allowing digressions without breaking the basic flow -- but they can also be crutches, giving the writer an illusion of organization when the material -- in actuality -- is a bit disorganized. And in any event, when overdone in an extreme -- as in this book -- it does disturb the flow, and it can get obnoxious real quick. Thank you, Michael, for this great and important book. But also, thanks for letting me see what it can feel like to be reading stuff with so much parenthetical dashing -- I might otherwise never have gotten it so vividly -- so that maybe I'll stop doing it myself.Nevertheless, 5 big stars.

From Trump treating the Presidency like a game of Stratego or Battleship, to the biggest collection of ""know-nothings"" ever assembled in a Presidential administration.....the hiring of unqualified people for the country's most important positions.....the constant struggle for favoritism from Trump by Bannon, Kushner and Ivanka..... the animosity and loathing amongst them.... What wouldn't be believable in this book?Michael Wolff's style in this book engages the reader actively because the subject material is both amusing and interesting. By the time I acquired this book in January, a good number of highlights had already been publicized in the news. For me, this book was a ""behind-the-scenes"" embedding of the author, with a ""seat on the 50-yard-line"". Who better to tell these stories? As an avid follower of political news, there is a 100% chance I believe that all of this is true.....and factual.Read it -- you won't want to put it down.

There is a lot to worry about with this presidency, if you weren't worried enough already. A few things really stand out. First, no one seems to be worried about doing the work of the American people, least of all Trump. The political infighting is incredible and insightful. Trump's office culture is reflective of his persona: one of chaos, pettiness, greed, ignorance and back stabbing. Bannon is most definitely the smartest guy in the room but the 2nd scariest, glad he is on the outside now. Read the book, it will make you realize more than ever how important it is for all of us to  get involved in our political system. Dark Money (very important book) put Trump in power.

1926,"Let me just get past the obvious and state that the book is absolutely worth reading.  I just spent the entire day reading it from cover to cover and feel better for being more informed.  Ignorance was bliss.  However, I have two big critiques:1.  Michael Wolff's vocabulary is not only vast, but impeccably utilized.  Combined with this deep knowledge of the field, you have a great ""guide"" into the Trump world with Wolff.  If you are on his level or, like me, have the benefit of a kindle to look things up, you are safe.  However, the constant obscure references, the spattering of French colloquialisms, and words like ""penultimate"" make him sound like a pretentious liberal dick.  You've written a masterpiece that may bring a standing president down, quit it with trying to show off.2.  The book is 2/3 about Bannon, not Trump.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing at all.  In fact, I'm glad for the in-depth knowledge and wonderfully detailed information.

How else does one call attention to oneself, when lacking actual talent or intelligence? I was set straight on one issue. It seems, from being stated outright to as he is portrayed in the book: Trump is fairly mild-mannered most of the time, and seeks approval of those he thinks are smarter and richer than he is. He is depicted as the big, dumb dog that rolls belly-up when another dog approaches, only to bark furiously when the same dog has left.

1933,Excellent - Mr Mueller will take a good look at some of the revelations,January-21-2018,5
1934,"Wolff paints a picture of a White House that's exactly what you'd expect given the news coverage of Trump's first year in office. Rivaling political factions competing for the affections of an ignorant, narcissistic leader make for an administration with no clear agenda and an impetuous decision-making style. The book is poorly written, however, and feels like it was rushed to print. Misspellings, punctuation errors, and grammatical mistakes often distract the reader from the author's point.I didn't think Wolff was nearly as hard on Trump as the media coverage of the book made him out to be. Overall, it's an interesting quick read and a good way to spend a weekend.",April-21-2018,3
1935,SCARY read if you love our country!,March-1-2018,4
1936,"Am now in the process of reading this book.  Don't know how to separate fact from fiction in the text, but Trump doesn't come out well.  I won't go into politics here but it is an interesting read.",January-16-2018,4
1937,"Every American should read this book! It exposes the Trump era for what it is, hypocrisy and the worst president we have had or (hopefully) ever will again.",February-25-2018,5
1938,Easy read. Good look into what was going on behind the scenes as most of the world looked on in horror. Nothing new here though.,March-18-2018,4
1939,"Entertainingly horrifying.  Because most of this we can see for ourselves, the rest is not too difficult to believe it could be true.",April-28-2018,5
1940,Great book!,January-29-2018,5
1941,"I purchased Wolffâ€™s book for my mom, and she is thoroughly enjoying it.  Iâ€™m sure sheâ€™s going to force the entire household to read it too.",February-26-2018,5
1942,The cease and desist letters compelled me to buy this book rather than just hear and read all the excerpts online.  Very glad I did. So much important background into this insanity we find ourselves living through. Every voter should read it.,January-6-2018,5
1943,"Yes, there are items that are questionable, but as the weeks roll on, we see these questionable items becoming more plausible. Soon we will see that suggestions in the entire publication are true. The author had nothing to lose, because he was not an officeholder and the subject could not bully him or publicly steamroller and negate  his writings. What a great opportunity for the public to be  fully informed of the twisted person who has become our nation's despot.",February-4-2018,5
1944,"While all of Mr. Wolffâ€™s claims in total are hard to believe,it is clear that he did have access to enough players (especially Bannon) to be offering many accurate insights into the circus of the current administration.  I enjoyed the book and would recommend it.",February-28-2018,5
1945,very interesting.....,February-4-2018,5
1946,A good record of what is going on,March-12-2018,5

1951,Love this book for the very reason knowing how WH is pissed off....priceless,February-19-2018,5
1952,"This is the first book by MIchael Wolff that I have read.  I found little ""new"" information that has not already been reported, in the past year, by CNN, which has been my constant companion during that time.  (Please take a moment to contemplate the structure of the previous sentence because that is Wolff's style, with even more subordinate clauses in this constructs.  I recall an early critique of 45's sentence structure and the impossibility of diagramming it.  Well, if you tried to diagram Wolff's sentences, the result would look like a fish skeleton.  And there were a handful on incomplete sentences in the book - and I'm a native English speaker but not otherwise an English language expert.  Where were the editors?  Anyway, this book was a must-read for anyone paying attention to contemporary politics.  I wouldn't say I particularly ""enjoyed"" it, but I did finish it quickly and may even reread it soon.  Just confirms that the current administration is a cluster f__k.  If you are a concerned citizen and eligible voter, start paying attention, get involved, get prepared to vote for sanity in 2018 and beyond.",January-8-2018,4
1953,"Well-done, but painful to read as an American.",February-26-2018,4
1954,"Holy smokes Batman! This book is riveting. Even if you were a staunch Republican, this could turn you into a Democrat well before you hit the 4th chapter.  Itâ€™s certain that Trumpâ€™s 35% will not be reading this, as there are lots of â€œbig wordsâ€ù in here.",January-17-2018,5

1959,"Very readable.  Some unexpected information, but nothing inconsistent with what was able to be gleaned from OUTSIDE the White House.",March-13-2018,4
1960,"Frightening,  just frightening.",March-13-2018,5
1961,The book is boring and poorly written--the author did not say a single thing that we followers did not already know....SNOOZE.,April-30-2018,2
1962,"Whether or not the anecdotes occurred  as stated does not matter. Instead see it as a broad stroke. The consequential incidents, policies, and actions of the Trump administration can be understood by this content as well as confirms the story within.",February-18-2018,5

1968,Interesting book!,March-2-2018,4
1969,"Now, the early days of the Trump presidency seem so long ago...who knows if the worst is yet to come?  I found Wolff's book funny and horrifying. Four years can seem like an eternity.",March-13-2018,4
1970,Itâ€™s a good read if youâ€™re not a trump fan.  Running it through another bank of editors would have been good.  So many errors and paragraph-long sentences full of digressing phrases and unnecessary adjective hyperbole hurt the credibility of the author.  I didnâ€™t need to be persuadedâ€”but this book wonâ€™t convince anyone on the fence or a fan of trump.,February-4-2018,3
1971,Here's all the tawdry tales of Trump presidential chaos.  The collected statements of Trump's insiders and employees is devastating.,March-10-2018,4
1972,Excellent written and very believable because it fits the story I observed on a daily basis for the last two and a half years.  thank you Mr. Wolff.,January-14-2018,4
1973,"May be only juicy gossip, but gave me great pleasure thinking about how I participated in a book which really upset a certain stable genius.",February-13-2018,5
1974,The book is very true about trump . I really canâ€™t say how I really feel.he should be impeached for all his lies and for all the women he lied about nothing going on between him and them . He is a lier and so on .,February-21-2018,5

1980,"is another name that could have been used for this book - Fire & Fury.The book confirms - with details - what we already know, unless youâ€™re a Fox Faux News watcher. The insider information is interesting, detailing the chaotic, bloody mess of Trump and the Trumpeters inside the White House.The book seemed rushed and could have used a good editing. Nearly every sentence is broken up with ad lib comments, making  it hard to read. In addition, the author used uncommon words throughout, which added unclarity of the point that was being made. Having it on Kindle definitely helps in looking up word definitions and knowing who the characters are when mentioned in Fire & Fury.I considered giving this book a 3 star rating, because the sentence structure  is unpleasant to read. I gave it 4 stars because the details of Trump's dysfunction was confirming: Iâ€™m not crazy to think the wheels have come off.",January-17-2018,4
1981,I found this book to be the true inside dealings of what I already assumed to be a totally dysfunctional White House Administration.,January-18-2018,5
1982,"The book is mainly ""gossipy"" in style, a tell-all about personalities.  I found reading Steele's report and the book and ""Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money and How Russian Helped Donald Trump Win"" by Luke Harding much more enlightening in regards to what is likely going on.",March-7-2018,3
1983,Opened my eyes more to the problems with our current administration. I am part way through and more firings every week.Not a way to run the Federal Government.,March-15-2018,5

1986,"Loved every minute reading that. Finished in one weekend, I couldnâ€™t set it down. Made me laugh until half way through it hit me that this is how these really act in the White House. So Hope Hicks really runs the show???",January-10-2018,5
1987,"Juicy? yes.  Tragic? Very.Pros:  reads fast, people/players are clearly identified and describedCons:  this is not fiction",January-10-2018,5

1989,"I love this book and read it, cover to cover (well, Kindle swipes)... its funny and if only a percent is true, we are in deep doo....",February-26-2018,5
1990,"Even if not 100% factually accurate, the fact that he gives such insight into how the Trump organization dysfunctions makes it worth the read.",February-19-2018,5
1991,"OK, so it's trashy and unreliable.  If you dislike Trump as much as I do, it's pure wish fulfillment.  Buy it for pleasure, not for information.",February-27-2018,5
1992,Good insight into the daily workings (or disfunction) of the Trump Whitehouse.,January-13-2018,5
1993,"From all the initial press, I expected this to be a partisan hatchet job.  It is, in fact, an honest attempt to try to understand whatâ€™s been happening for the past year in the White House.  It has given me so much to think about.",February-17-2018,5
1994,"A good book, and I believe that most of it is true, but I'm sure that some is not.  We'll have to wait and see if it is, or not.",March-10-2018,4
1995,"If it wasn't true, you still couldn't put it down.  As I write this review months after the books release, I can say that facts seem to be lining up that Wolff knew what he was talking about.",March-15-2018,5
1996,"If even half of it is true, it is very frightening. Surely holds your interest.  Marilyn",January-18-2018,5
1997,A good read!!!,January-10-2018,5
1998,A must read. Best book of 2018. It captures the true spirit of inside the White House. Couldnâ€™t put it down.,January-30-2018,5
1999,"Excellent work by Wolff. It's well-written and fast-paced, but also offers a surprising amount of depth and insight lacking from most daily news accounts. While nearly every access journalist hack clutches their pearls and proclaims, ""Michael Wolff doesn't play nice,"" before noting that basically everything Wolff writes is consistent with inside sources. Wolff, by being a mensch, has done a great service to the nation. His name deserves to go down with the likes of Halberstam and Caro as among the great writers on American politics.",January-7-2018,5
2000,"However badly you think Trump is doing, it's ten times worse. Maybe more. Trump is amazingly stupid, and this book tell us why.",March-10-2018,5
2001,Highly entertaining.  Wolff is a very good writer.  I bought it the first day it was a available as an e-book.  They clearly rushed it to publication.  Editor's errors abound.,January-14-2018,5
2002,"Honestly, I just ordered the book, and solely for the purpose of showing POTUS that this is how America works. We don't allow our leaders to quash free speech. I feel like it was like super dumb of him to give it more attention. As he knows, any press is good press. :)",January-8-2018,5
2003,"This book just confirms what I see and hear every day, hell, every hour of how unfit Trump is to lead our great country. I wasn't shocked.",February-10-2018,5
2004,Itâ€™s interesting to find out exactly how immature our so-called president is but the book with its constant interruptions on m-dashes is hard to get through. The m-dash asides in the middle of every paragraph are so distracting I had to skip them to understand what the author meant.,February-25-2018,3
2005,"I have not yet completed the reading, but I certainly will do so.  I know that it will make me reflect on our country's leader and his incapability to think of anything tor the good of all our people (yes, including immigrants - after all, only our Native Americans are not immigrants).  All he can think of is himself and how much money he can bilk from our country and our people plus his ignorant rhetoric in attacking anyone who disagrees with him.  Not my idea of a wise leader - not one bit!  Joan G. Schultz",March-21-2018,5
2006,"I bought the audiobook version, and the narration is easy to listen to, the narrators voice is evenhanded. It's so hard to say that the book is wonderful, because the revelations of the book are disturbing.  That's why I only listen when I am working out, walking or cleaning house.I think this is the most important book I have read in at least a year. Since Trump was elected I have been thinking - what would I give to be a fly on the wall hearing what is going on within the administration. Turns out Michael Wolff was that fly. I feel like the view the public has gotten of this presidential administration is so strange - fits and starts, president contradicting his own staff as well as himself, rapid firings and hirings. It's like we have been watching a dogfight going on under a blanket, and it's hard to figure out what is what. This book helps so much.. Not because of any individual facts... But the broad strokes - A president with little to no ability to delay his own responses to frustration, driven solely by the desire to be liked and admired - alternating between puffery when his ego is gratified  and lashing out with insults when it is not.. And those who surround him, carefully jockeying to be the one soothing him and whispering in his ear.  It's a frightening picture, but one that makes sense given the history of the last year.I hope and pray that intelligent and calm adults manage to insinuate themselves close to this man to insure the safety of our nation and the people in it for how ever long his presidency continues.",January-18-2018,5
2007,great book,January-26-2018,4
2008,"Widely quoted for good reason.  It confirms what we already know.  Trump is totally unfit to lead anything, and a danger to our republic.",March-13-2018,4
2009,"I found the writing overblown and the bad editing maddening (why only 3 stars), but the topic was engrossing and I couldn't put it down.",February-4-2018,3
2010,Has an understated drollery that is delightful.  Inside these covers is an excellent summary of the nature of our worst president and the danger he poses to civilization.  What have we done?,January-9-2018,4
2011,Loved it!! Couldn't put it down.,January-21-2018,5
2012,"The gist of this tome jibes with everything that sensible Americans have observed ... Chaos rules in the White House. In particular, Wolff shows how Trump assembled a ""C or D"" caliber team, and they ended up in positions of global importance.",January-6-2018,5
2013,Love it.,February-28-2018,5
2014,This fills in the gaps of what you were thinking was true all along.  Our president is a helpless man-child dumber than dirt.,January-17-2018,5
2015,"What a bunch of characters- unfortunate that the events of this book are true, but entertaining read you will want to check out",January-7-2018,5
2016,"Yeah - its a gossip book, but its vastly more revealing than the Trump adm. will try to make you believe. Wellwritten and readable",February-4-2018,5
2017,"If I could only be a fly on the wall at the oval office for just one day I could actually verify some of these things that are written in some books about Trump. I actually like Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump WH. It was peculiarly revealing in a sense that made you think, OMG, what and who is in the WH.  It actually made me fear for my life and that of generations to come.  This is not a normal situation as you will begin understand from the get go of the end of the election.  Family in the WH like it was a get together and a nasty one at that. Bannon's grandiose delusions and paranoia of different races of people.  Trump never reading memos or spread sheets and hates meetings with head officials. You will need to read the book and hope you're being told the truth because if you think things are in a bad way now by just reading Trumps tweets, you'll be surprised and maybe a bit fearful for the next 3 years if he's not impeached by then.",February-19-2018,4
2018,I got a great visual of a white house and administration that I can't stand. I could picture the whole book as he was saying it,January-28-2018,5
2019,"Proof that some things that go bump in the night ARE actually monsters. For those of us who have been apprehensive about the appearance of duplicity, narcissism, bigotry, and utter incompetence (those things that bump), this book provides a framework in which to understand these fears, and to acknowledge their basis in reality.",March-16-2018,5
2020,"Read it.  But know... it is not a book you should approach to figure out, ""oh, this is true"" and ""that's not verifiable"" and now I know the facts of all things that happened. In my opinion, it's a very believable  collection of stories curated by the author in a way that hangs together. Honestly, while it makes me sad to look behind the curtain, it helps to have the back story and see the weaknesses that might eventually bring this charade to an end.... ideally, long before 2020. Also, I really enjoyed how Wolff used so many long words and adjectives upon adjectives to describe things. I kept thinking, even if Trump tried to read this, he would never be able to understand what was being said!!!",January-15-2018,5
2021,"Not wholly sure the accuracy of parts of the book are true true; some seem written as they are implied true. Overall it was a good read, certainly lends credence to the hopefully sooner rather than later implosion of the tRump presidency.",January-21-2018,4
2022,interesting,February-24-2018,4
2023,"Insider exposÃ©. I canâ€™t believe this man was elected. His financial connections will bring us all down, not just Steve Bannon.",January-12-2018,5
2024,Yes it has quite a lot of vocab words. That's why I gave this book to my 7th grader to read as extra-curriculum reading. She is doing fabulously.,February-5-2018,5
2025,"Nothing surprising. It did shed a clearer light on a few of the lesser known details, though.",January-11-2018,5

2027,"Michael Wolff's book, Fire and Fury: Inside The Trump White House, was quite revealing in terms of the inner workings, rivalries, and in-fighting within the Trump White House.Mr. Wolff's up close perspective gives the reader a unique view of the characters, intrigue, and chaos in the West Wing. It is informative, insightful, and most entertaining!",May-1-2018,5
2028,great entertainment and reading,January-19-2018,5
2029,Really learn nothing new and a great deal of speculation from the writer.  I finished the book but was bored with it about half way through.  It really just reiterates how dysfunctional this president is and continues to be.  Not worth buying just listen to 30 minutes of CNN and you'll get the gist of the book.,March-3-2018,3
2030,"I absolutely cannot put this book down!  I havenâ€™t been this excited about getting â€˜hot off the pressâ€™ info since watching the O.J. Simpson trial live on Court TV! Iâ€™ve read 11 chapters in the 13 hours since the book was released & I certainly donâ€™t consider my day wasted.  While Iâ€™d not consider myself completely well-versed & polished in the area of politics, I do watch â€˜fake newsâ€™ daily & scan my iphoneâ€™s newsfeed nightly for info on Trumpâ€™s latest controversial tweets & to make sure that I donâ€™t need to find a nearby bomb shelter soon.  I gave the book 4 stars only because it got a bit deep in places & in my opinion, it wasnâ€™t written for the masses.  Without a fairly hearty attention span & a bit of a knack for politics, this might be a difficult read.",January-5-2018,4

2034,Was not likely to purchase the book. Until you know who attempted to take that right away.,January-25-2018,5
2035,Fascinating read exposing the disaster that is the trump administration. I have no doubt trump didn't want to or expect to win.,February-22-2018,5
2036,"The Washington Post is doing its best reporting since Watergate.  Rachel Maddow, among others, is at the top of her game.  But they cannot do what  Fire and Fury does so well.  This narrative romp through the characters in the White House is impossible to put down.",January-20-2018,5
2037,"Some of it was a little off the wall, but, in general it was a good review of the first months of the Trump administration.",February-27-2018,4
2038,Scary read of what's going on in leadership. Some confirms a lot of what we know already know it suspect (yikes!!!) But a some of it is unsubstantiated information that doesn't have much to back it up but trusting the author and our own gut/knee-jerk instincts,January-29-2018,3
2039,"I bought the book a few hours ago and already read the first 2 chapters. It's simply mind-blowing and quite entertaining (well, it would be entertaining if the main protagonist was not president of the US...). I usually don't read politics books, but after the over-the-top reaction of the Trump team I decided to give it a shot: if Trump is losing sleep over this book, that means it must be true.",January-5-2018,5

2042,A good read Nothing new to learn but a time passer And fun to try an d figure out if Trump is really that unpredictable and babyish,February-1-2018,4
2043,"I was pleasantly surprised. After all the hype I was expecting to be disappointed but quite the opposite. Filled in the gaps of what we already knew. Confirmed the White House, GOP etc a shambles and Trump totally incompetent. Very interesting read behind the scenes.",February-13-2018,5

2048,"This book is as frightening as it is readable, and it should be read by every American. Wolff's portrait of a president who is a reckless, dementia-addled fool, surrounded by impotent sycophants inside the White House confirms one's deepest fears. You wish that this incredible intrigue were taking place at some other time, in some remote land, and that the people involved had no possible means of affecting one's life or livelihood, since they are not capable, intelligent, civic-minded, nor even rational. If these people weren't running the country, it would be pure pleasure watching them shred each other to pieces.Wolff's writing style is seductive, pithy and intelligent.I feel there is a gap now, between when the book ends, and today, but, unfortunately, I doubt Wolff will be invited back to the White House to fill in the gap. We can only guess what mess is being cooked up behind closed doors now.",January-7-2018,5
2049,"A must read about dysfunction and resulting grim resultsthat will certainly continue if the readers does not speak up and act wisely.

2051,"Well, reading this just confirms what I have always thought about Donald Trump: nothing the man says makes any sense to me. He seems to just want to attack and insult anyone who doesn't agree with him at the moment. That is about as egocentric - and chaotic - as one can get. Lots of internecine factions -  Bannon, Jarvanka, and mainstream GOP -- trying to tame this tiger that they have by its tail. The saddest part, of course, is that the majority of Americans and the World at large will be the recipients of the legacy of the worst administration ever, by any standard one uses -- consistency, empathy, political smarts, expertise, diplomacy, ad infinitum. Celebrity, entitlement of the rich, lying, intimidation, and media hype have delivered us a Trumpian world. This books details the reality show horror that is the Trump Presidency. I await what the Mueller Investigation reveals.",January-16-2018,5

2053,I was impressed by the access the author had and the riveting accounts of the Trump insiders. Totally revealing. Creates a sense of urgency that we as citizens have to speak through our votes to remove this corrupt individual and great danger to our Democracy. This book helps us to haveno illlusion about the true character of DJT through the words and opinions of his own white house staff.,January-10-2018,5
2054,Well written and full of interesting facts and anecdotes.  It's a must read and answers a lot of questions.,March-20-2018,5
2055,Very well-written and absorbing.  Really keeps your interest.  I wish he'd write an update!,March-9-2018,5
2056,This is such an easy read and does really portray a glimpse into the chaos in the current administration!,April-27-2018,5
2057,Good take down of Donald Trump.,January-11-2018,5
2058,"Wolff paints a picture of a White House in chaos with a temperamental, ill-informed and only semi-literate POTUS at the helm. Fire and Fury is a must-read for its insider's peek into a volatile West Wing.",January-5-2018,5
2059,"Wickedly funny and dreadful all at once. I'd enjoy it a whole lot more if this were fiction instead of the reality that's happening to our precious democracy. Maybe some of the writing isn't exactly accurate (10%?),  but anyone who pays attention to what's happening it's easy to see there's not much in this book to doubt. It really simply confirms what we already know.",March-13-2018,5
2060,"Some parts were unbelievable, but good insight overall.  I can not believe he just sat on the couch in the oval office through all these discussions",February-2-2018,4
2061,This book provided the insider-fly-on-the-wall view of what the public was never privy to ... the inner workings of the dysfunctional leadership of our country. It was interesting to read of the two camps who engaged in a power struggle to control the man we call Mr. President. This book presented a sad yet stomach churning revelation of the leadership of our country.,January-31-2018,4
2062,"If only 50% of this alarming expose' is true, we have much to worry about.The most unsettling disclosure is the fact that Trump's son-in-law and daughter are in charge, causing competent advisors to resign or be fired by Trump. One wishes that the author had cited his sources; footnotes are not included in what could have been a 95% believable book.",January-23-2018,4
2063,"Informative.  Fills in some background. Book, however, is poorly edited with mangled syntax and strange vocabulary choices.",March-12-2018,4
2064,Now I understand why POTUS appears so inept to the public.,February-28-2018,5
2065,Just as I thought.,January-13-2018,5
2066,"An easy read that gives you an exciting and disturbing insight into the circles of power in and around the white house, said to be the power hub of the strongest power in this world. A signal How that power is disintegrating.",March-9-2018,4
2067,"The reality of the Trump presidency was focused into a single narrative. The at times fictional analysis of the personalities, their interactions and  manipulation of Trump to achieve their right wing agenda. The facts as well as fiction are necessary to understand the complexities and dangers of what is unfolding in the most important democracy in the world.",January-10-2018,5
2068,Rate a 5***** Wolff writes it like it is. Insight into Trumps inner sanctum is astonishing matched only by the incongruity of it. *****,March-15-2018,5
2069,"Very interesting book, which helped me to understand the apparent (and actual) chaos in the White House post-election.",March-12-2018,5
2070,I've enjoyed the confirmation of what a horrible person T____ is along with all those he surrounded himself with.  What a joke he and his groupies are!,March-5-2018,5
2071,"Very interesting content, but poorly written. The voice is windy and winding...many single-sentence paragraphs that go on for 10+ lines. I know they rushed this to print, so I can overlook the typos (there are many). But overly complicated sentence structure and lack of editing make it a rough read. Not sure if I'll finish it or not.",February-4-2018,3
2072,"If 1% is true, we are in BIG TROUBLE.",February-5-2018,5
2073,Have not read it yet.  I wish  it were in large print and in paperback.  But I am anxious to read what is in it since it has caused such a fury!,January-26-2018,5
2074,"I am glad I pre-ordered this book when I first heard about the fallout behind it. I took a day off from writing part of my dissertation to read this. All I can say is, LORD have MERCY...this is a shame and scandal...a shame and a scandal! Mr. Wolff definitely delivered in his take of the President's first year in office. Scathing accounts and so, detailed. My favorite quote in the book was ""He (Trump) was what he was. A twinkle in his eye, larceny in his soul"". OMG! This was a fantastic read, what a great way to kick off 2018. Please support Mr. Wolff and buy this book, all of you who care the events that have transpired thus far; this book offers explanations behind them. I had never read about so much backbiting and discourse...EVER!!!!!!!!",January-6-2018,5
2075,A lot of this I already had heard in the media. However it was interesting reading how the author had perceived / observed from the inside.,April-19-2018,4
2076,"I didn't want to give this book credit, but when Trump said it shouldn't be published I just had to.  Very poorly written. Definitely not editeded.  It reads like a stupid gossip column, which it is.  Thank God for the career government workers who keep our country up and running",January-11-2018,3
2077,"This book was ok.  I believe most of what I read in it.  I mean just look at how crazy this guy is in real life, so it wasn't hard to believe this book.  It was well written, I think it was a little too long, but again, look at the subject of the book.",March-16-2018,3
2078,This book even more validated our White House is being run by a bunch of inexperienced clowns. Chaotic as it's best.,January-19-2018,5
2079,"What can I say?  Even if you're a s""Trumpet"" you've got to wonder what the hell is going on???",March-16-2018,4
2080,"Anyone who has been paying even the slightest bit of attention for the last year will find it very easy to believe everything in this book. There wasn't one thing in the book that surprised me. Trump is an unhinged man living in a universe all his own. I actually feel very bad for anyone who believes this man is ""great"", for they must have some very sad issues of their own. How this country has been able to fall so far is truly scary. His supporters will scream ""lies"" and ""fake news"" just as ""The Donald"" has taught them to do but I honestly hope they regain the ability to think on their own someday.",January-6-2018,5
2081,"It is a fly on the wall book, not sit down interviews. I found it interesting.",January-11-2018,5
2082,"EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, WHETHER A TRUMP FAN OR NOT.",January-29-2018,5
2083,I really enjoyed this book and I think most everyone would like it whether theyâ€™re a far left liberal or a Trump supporter.,February-11-2018,5
2084,The most interesting part is learning about some of the other people in the White House and how they sublimate themselves to be working with such a deplorable human being.  I find it amazing that so many voters could have voted for such a man.,March-7-2018,4
2085,"According to media reports not everything is the book is 100% accurate, but it really rings true from what I have observed from and about Trump from a variety of media sources.  Enjoyed readint it",February-2-2018,5
2086,"Not exactly â€œgreat literatureâ€ù or writing but a fun dishy read, satisfying if youâ€™re frustrated with current events",March-6-2018,3
2087,Good reading. Wow what a book. But at the same time after reading it. He really needs to be impeached,March-23-2018,5
2088,It was just like we've been seeing on the news.  Michael Wolff did a very accurate depiction of the mess in Washington.,February-5-2018,5
2089,This book discusses many of the news items on the trump administration from the past year. Insight into the incompetence  of the current president.,January-21-2018,4
2090,Amazing insight into the White House workings under the current administration.  This book explains the chaos and insanity.,February-23-2018,5
2091,VERY INTERESTING AND ALSO INTRIGUE. I PERSONALLY THINK MOST OF THIS BOOK TO BE TRUE BUT AT THE SAME TIME A LITTLE FRIGHTENING TO REALIZE THE BEHIND THE SCENES OF WHO is in charge God help us all in this good country for the next three years,January-24-2018,5
2092,"If nothing else, this merely confirms - in great detail - how far the ability and intelligence of our top â€œleadersâ€ù has fallen. It really is worse than anything weâ€™ve been led to believe.",January-13-2018,5
2093,"An interesting read, not always easy to follow. If only half of this account is accurate then it still raises serious questions about how Trump could possibly have fooled the people into thinking he was a safe pair of hands when he clearly has limited ability.",February-18-2018,3
2094,Good insight into the chaos of the Trumpâ€™s administration and the child we call President,April-26-2018,5
2095,"The book definitely seems credible.  Some of the events predicted in the book, such as firing Rex Tillerson and replacing him with Mike Pompeo, have come to pass since the book was published.  It was very interesting (and scary) reading.",April-10-2018,5
2096,"Considering what has been happening in the Trump disorganization as of March 2018, March Madness takes on a whole new meaning.",March-6-2018,4
2097,"Well organized and fast-reading, but information dense account of Trump Whitehouse.  As far as the Whitehouseâ€™s panning of the book, most of the information isnâ€™t a surprise watching Trump speak and Trumps â€œsuccessful billionaireâ€ù nonsense pre-election has been already reported.",January-6-2018,5
2098,"There are some interesting observations & illuminating insider perspectives throughout.  Howevert what is billed as a factual recount actually has a lot of the authors' own spin, bias, and interpretation tied to it.  As a warning ... don't try to listen to the audio version in the car with the kids listening, there is a good amount of foul language interspersed throughout the pages.",March-21-2018,3
2099,"I know it was written in a hurry, and it shows it. The author uses way too many words that readers are going to have to look up to understand what he is saying.  And I'm not illiterate.  I know it adds to colorful writing, but it is just excessive in my opinion.",March-16-2018,3
2100,Interesting but a bit boring after awhile.Good job describing the dysfunctional Trump clan.,April-6-2018,5
2101,I see why Trump and his lawyers tried so very hard to block this books distribution.Fascinating inside look at what is going to be one of the biggest debacles in American history.,February-12-2018,5
2102,"Have not read this one yet, but wanted to be sure we had it in our home collection for the children to read whenever...",February-9-2018,3
2103,I admit I'm a political junkie and I really liked this book.  There are minor editing errors but they do not distract from the overall coverage of this White House.  I like the way Michael Wolff writes and I think he did a very good job with this book.,January-9-2018,5
2104,"This tome seemed a wee bit over the top when it came out (and I read it).  Now it seems understated.Funny how the flow of time will do that to a book.  ""Instant"" history, but worth reading.",March-7-2018,4
2105,Very good read. I would recommend this book.,February-8-2018,5
2106,Not sure I learned a whole lot new. It felt like I was reading a load of newspaper articles from the last year. If you believe even half of it though Americans and the rest of the world should be real scared of what this president could get up to.,March-23-2018,4
2107,An eye-opener.,February-17-2018,4
2108,The book certainly rings true in many places.  It is relevant and sad. The book reads like a non-stop newspaper with details on many of the topics and issues one reads and hears daily about the ignorance and fecklessness of the current White House.,April-2-2018,5
2109,"This book is eye-opening and shocking. I realize that Micahel Wolff is getting a lot of pushback from certain journalists and Trump lovers attempting to discredit him, but I have read that his book just affirms what others know or have written. A must-read for anyone who is interested in what went on in the White House in the first months.",February-4-2018,5
2110,Liked this book. Made my worst fears seem justified. Of course if your a Trump fan...well better not get it.,March-13-2018,5
2111,Wolff is both organized and insightful. He present the Trump year without making it slant one way or the other.,January-16-2018,5
2112,This was fun reading.  I don't doubt that 99% of what's written in this book is true and actually happened.,March-14-2018,4
2113,"Great book of a tell all. Maybe one sided, though puts some insights to some of the most controversial issues that ensued in this presidency. Would like to read a tell all from a republican.",January-25-2018,5
2114,"Very interesting. If anywhere near a true depiction of what goes on, then this country is in trouble. To have only two ""real' candidates of the likes of Clinton and Trump demonstrates what disaster our so-called republic has become. Glad I am old without that many more years left. Can't fathom of how much more ineptness and incompetency our poor nation can take.",March-13-2018,5
2115,Can one say they actually like this type of book?  There are some juicy tidbits and Wolff characterizes the chaos of the current administration so well that I could actually hear POTUS spewing.  Too bad this is not a dream but our current reality.  Geri Thomas,February-5-2018,3
2116,I'll never be a Trump fan.  I didn't like him when he made his first pronouncements against Mexico. I'll continue to respect the office but not the man.,February-23-2018,3
2117,"Puply, juicy, and infuriating.  Unbelievably  terse. Some of the events sound as if they were written in a crime novel.  In a country where we are told than any child can become president,  this is what what happens when one does.  Makes ""1984"" sound like ""Pollyanna"".",March-7-2018,5
2118,If only half of the story is true it's still incredible to me we could have this guy as our president. I believe that most of it is true.,March-11-2018,5
2119,"The book was interesting, but I canâ€™t really say that I learned much more than has already been portrayed by the media. Would have rather heard more about the presidentâ€™s demeanor, actions  and how things happened on a day to day basis as supposedly witnessed by an insider.",January-15-2018,3
2120,"Hard to LOVE this book given the content but it is excellent. I highly recommend listening to it on Audible. Great for long car drives for my husband and me. We haven't finished it but so far, we feel it's VERY well done.",March-20-2018,5
2121,"I could go on and on. As 2018 is moving ahead, the more you will believe every word in this book. Our Prez is already an open book, pun intended!There are certain parts which are way too slow and unnecessary. But its a good read overall !",March-29-2018,5
2122,"45 is a disgrace, and the book proves that everything we though about this psychopath, he is and more.  A great read!",February-21-2018,5
2123,I am looking forward to reading more from this author in the future. Good too see the truth behind the faÃ§ade.,March-1-2018,5
2124,"This book is more tabloid gossip than real news, but was an entertaining read.  I would imagine there is some truth mixed with some exaggeration, but overall a good read.",March-11-2018,4
2125,"This entire story is stranger than fiction, to use the old phrase. So even if it's not all true, it's a fascinating read. Extremely engaging and well-writen. Each day I feel like this book gets more credibility by actual events, not fake news. The events are playing out before us. Who would have ever guessed we would be here?",April-11-2018,5
2126,"An arduous read but very enlightening and frightening. The bulk of which seems to be from the viewpoint of Bannon, but Mr. Wolff definitely reveals who is still left in the henhouse and who is actually in charge.",February-6-2018,4
2127,I bought this book just to spite the stablegenius,January-6-2018,5
2128,This was scary and makes one more alert about our government!,January-31-2018,5
2129,"Very informative and a good read.  Even if some contents are inaccurate enough remains that explains Mr. Trump's antics as President (and, his behavior now).",February-5-2018,5
2130,"A quick, salacious read.  What is written in these pages is almost hard to believe.  Almost.  Until you recall all that has happened and know, with this administration, it's likely true.  Any doubt has been removed by these things actually washing out in the media now.  The White House is a madhouse, full of dummies, backstabbers, and petty ladder climbers.",March-8-2018,5
2131,"Worth the money, if for no other reason than to gain a better understanding of how Americans can be duped into placing this man into the Office of the Presidency of the United States of America.",February-23-2018,5
2132,Everyone should read this and work to save our citizens and our Constitution. We must stop money from running our elections.,February-6-2018,5
2133,"The incompetence and naivety of everyone mentioned in this book is astounding. And it gives me hope.A fun read, although the content is mostly in the first third of the book. I was shocked to hear Trump struggles with â€œexecutive function.â€ù",January-16-2018,5
2134,"This is the first book of Mr. Wolff that I read. I very much enjoyed his writing style. The information is presented chronologically and clearly. I also enjoyed the analysis he presents. I did detect a bias and it is, of course, up to the readers to do their own analysis and reach their own conclusions, but, it is nonetheless a very interesting and insightful read.",February-13-2018,5
2135,To be totally honest I have yet to read it.  I only bought it because Trump did not want us to _Ÿ˜‚  I might not ever read it but anything that bothered him as much as this was completely worth the purchase!,March-7-2018,5
2136,Wish I could get this for 3 1/2 stars because it does give a glimpse into the huge dysfunction of the Trump White House. My problem was that I lost interest about halfway through and couldn't continue. Some of the stories  have the earmarks of an exaggeration or secondhand gossip but the entire picture seems accurate.,March-17-2018,3
2137,The more I read about the Trump administration and White House the  more it is evident he should have NEVER been elected.  Shameful.,April-25-2018,5
2138,Explains the chaos in the White House. What a circus.  I don't know how anyone who works there stays sane.,March-7-2018,5
2139,"Interesting look inside the Trump regime. The chaos, flip flops, and outright lies have been on display since the campaign, but the book verifies much of that from the inside. However, there are items of unverified speculation that are put forth as fact.",March-7-2018,3
2140,"This book disappointed me because of what is missing, namely better understanding of political issues and history.  The ""fire and fury"" is not about issues, but individuals and their actions, making it seem more of a gossip column than a serious study.  Too many names and details, nothing at all about what it all means for this country.  If we don't already realize who is this POTUS we will not know much more after reading it.",February-5-2018,3
2141,"Has a good index, which I periodically use to look up anecdotes about the latest characters talked about in the soap opera/news!",April-25-2018,5
2142,"Totally worth the $15 FOR the 1st Amendment, democracy, honesty, and the 99%, and AGAINST imbecillic narcisism, corruption, fake news, racism, and Russian intervention.",January-6-2018,5
2143,"Very interesting read about what went on in the White House during the first year of the Trump administration. Confirmed a lot of what many suspect, and seemed very credible. Somewhat frightening to have suspicions confirmed. Liked the quick pace of the book. The author has a way of constructing some sentences that were not easy to follow.",March-7-2018,4
2144,Thoroughly enjoyed reading this.  I believe it is closer to the truth than not.  Suggest everyone read it.,March-14-2018,5
2145,Love this book. Buy it!,March-9-2018,5
2146,"considering the shenanigans in the Whitehouse that are reported every day, this is very easy to believe.",March-11-2018,5
2147,"Confirms what most of us already suspected. Wolf's ""fly n the wall"" perspective results in a uniquely sordid picture. Hoping it will, along with the tapes he has to back up his assertions, open the eyes of some (like half of Congress) that have remained resolutely shut their the duration of this nightmarish administration.",January-6-2018,5
2148,"What can I say? If you haven't read it yet, you already know you'll love it. And you know you want the dirt.",March-13-2018,5
2149,"Great book, other than the fact that it's nonfiction and the sad reality of the U.S.Republican administration.",January-10-2018,5
2150,"Wonderful book.  Shall finish it when a have a little more time.  Frank and open and objectively finding Trump seriously wanting as President of the United States--not to mention dangerously lacking in impulse control, mercurial, uninformed, etc.",March-27-2018,5
2151,"....and many of us thought, it couldn't be that bad.  WRONG!  He has confirmed our most frightening thoughts.",February-22-2018,5
2152,"Whether this is all fiction, facts or a combination of both, the end result is crazy enough to be as true Trump is President.I've never read Mr. Moore's stuff before. This book seem hurried and a field stitching of notes taken on a yellow legal pad.",January-13-2018,5
2153,"To be fair I have not actually read this book, I only bought it to keep it on the bestseller list.  #resist",March-14-2018,5
2154,"Reads like a juicy tell-all about Hollywood or music industry celebrity. Easy read, especially if you don't like the President. After finishing it, I felt like I do after I eat too much cake or listen to too much gossip -- guilty and queasy.",March-26-2018,4
2155,Captivating !!! Wolff paints a disorganized and chaotic White House with DJT as the Emperor with no clothes. Must read for anyone interested in understanding the strange set of circumstances that led up to DJT's 2016 win and his 1st 6 months as POTUS.,January-10-2018,4
2156,"Run on sentences...difficult to know what he was getting at. Poorly written, and I am no fan of current president, -At All!",January-15-2018,3
2157,Finally arrived! Can't wait to read this BEST SELLER!Only bought this book to see it make the best seller list.,January-27-2018,5
2158,"Entirely believable if you have been following the election and administration...and I have been.The caste of characters is well revealed for the American public to finally see. Our nation is indeep trouble with this white supremacist (and he is) in office. The damage he has already done, and the damage we can expect over the tenure, will be heart stopping. My only hope is Robert Mueller, frankly, but the thought of Pence taking over is equally horrifying. Read it.",January-12-2018,5
2159,"I did not know I could laugh so much from such deadpan accounts of pure chaos on Earth. The book might have robbed me of my sanity and numbed my fight or flight responses down to an absolute coma, but I enjoyed every moment of it.",February-21-2018,5
2160,"Nothing in the book is really shocking based on how things have gone over the past year. Once I heard the WH pressing back on it so adamantly, it peaked my curiosity even more. Easy to read, some grammatical errors, but very interesting yet disturbing all at the same time. Haven't been able to put the book down since I got it.",January-8-2018,5
2161,What can you say about this current administration and the annals recorded in this book. I just sit back and shake my head. An informative insight into the interworkings of the current administration and key player involved in shaping the next four years of American history. Buckle up!,February-14-2018,3
2162,Helped me keep track of who is who in year one of the Trump White House.  A sad account of people given power who are not qualified to wield it.,January-11-2018,5
2163,Too bad this book is all about Trump.  The book is well written and now I cant stand Mr. Trump.  Hes not my President.,March-10-2018,4
2164,A great account of the drama behind the decisions we have seen this administration make. No one really looks any good.,January-20-2018,5
2165,"This book is very well written. It gives the ""fly on the wall"" perspective of life in the Trump White House. I had to look up many words in the dictionary which is good for an avid reader like me. Now when I see people resigning or getting fired it is as if I know them.",March-7-2018,5
2166,"Gunfight at the OK Corral. White House insiders go from concealed to open carry gun rules in an easy to binge on narrative with many direct quotes. Assuming he has recorded corroboration for them, Michael Wolff may go down in history for rescuing the U.S. from the gang that couldnâ€™t shoot straight.",January-7-2018,5
2167,A must read for anyone concerned with the security of our country!,February-21-2018,5
2168,This is not a book for Trump supporters. The content is largely hearsay. There is enough stuff that rings true to make you wonder. Iâ€™m not a Republican so I liked it.,February-7-2018,5
2169,Required but tough reading...,January-22-2018,5
2170,"The recipient loved this book, said the amount of scandalous dirt is amazing.  She couldnâ€™t put it down.",March-5-2018,5
2171,It was even better than I anticipated. It was really hard to stop reading it once I got into it. I hope that a sequel is written!,March-22-2018,5
2172,Loved the conversational style and inside scoop! Least liked the fact that it contained many instances I was already aware of.,February-12-2018,5
2173,confirms suspicions,January-19-2018,5
2174,This gives a detailed insight into the early days of the Trump administration. There are many interesting quotes from Steve Bannon.,February-28-2018,4
2175,"A fabulous story. Given the seriousness of the situation, itâ€™s probably the wrong reaction, but I kept having to laugh out loud. Itâ€™s wonderfully written, and even though, as many have pointed out, there really is nothing new and surprising in the book, it really puts the entire Trump White House in perspective. Questions have been raised about Wolffâ€™s methods and the accuracy of some details, but with this post-factual presidency, such concerns are almost irrelevant. To adopt a phrase much used about Trump, take the book seriously, even if you donâ€™t believe every vignette literally. This is really whatâ€™s been going on in our name, paid for by us.",January-15-2018,5
2176,It's the best thing to come out from this administration if it wasn't so scary .Why so many people believed in trump's BS boggles the mind  if it sounds to good to be true  well you know the rest I almost felt sorry for Steve bannon I said almost he's just like Trump but with a brain a deadly combination,March-8-2018,5
2177,Interesting book with a few more details than I learned from daily news articles in the newspaper or on TV. Did not quite finish it yet but will as soon as I have the time.,March-8-2018,4
2178,"I guess that for a people who knows about politics this book will be the bomb. For me it was not because I had no idea who the people mentioned in the book were. I was expecting more juice gossip hollywood style. But, I admit it is good.",March-30-2018,5
2179,A lot of the content was reported by the media. I found it disturbing. I am amazed this man is president of our country!!,February-11-2018,4
2180,"A lot of hype about this book, but I was left disappointed. Still don't regret buying it though, as I hope it will encourage more writers/journalists/human beings to document the ridiculously appalling trump white house",February-12-2018,3
2181,A penetrating look at inside the Trump Whitehouse. Many of Wolffâ€™s reports have subsequently been confirmed.,March-7-2018,5
2182,Trump sucks and this book reiterates that in several ways.  Enjoyable read for Democrats.,May-3-2018,5
2183,great read !,February-3-2018,5
2184,Gave me more reasons to feel disgusted about this man and his family.,February-28-2018,5
2185,Gave it a 3 1/2 at one time. The story is interesting and readable. There does not seem to be a lot of definitive sources. It is more balanced than one would originally expect but is open ended enough that any partisan (of either side)can claim bias,February-4-2018,3
2186,"It was a bit like watching the news, only with more detail. It is a behind the scenes look at the current dysfunctional White House. We get to see a detailed account of the in-fighting between all the participants. Trump seems to be who I believed him to be - a self-centered, entitled  three year old. I think it will be an even better book - when people read it in the future to learn what happened now",January-21-2018,4
2187,It's a page turner. It's amazing that the white house allowed a reporter such intimate and free access.,March-3-2018,5
2188,"Tell  all about the nut jobs that are running the oval office. Even if one doesn't believe all of it , just letting the author shadow the white house staff says a lot about the judgement of the people currently in the white house.",January-12-2018,5
2189,"Loved the book. Even if it may be a little over dramatic, it's a clear reflection of how sad a state the US is in right now.",March-13-2018,5
2190,My husband wanted to read it. He said that the book was okay. There was stuff in there that people need to know.,February-11-2018,5
2191,Book is incredible and worth all of the hype it received. Read it and see for yourself!! Casual observances and circumstances in the media are explained in this book in a very logical manner. Makes sense to the reader.  Read it and judge for yourself.,February-19-2018,5
2192,Very informative and well written. Nice to know the way our government is being run!!! Not to my liking!!!_Ÿ˜¢,February-4-2018,5
2193,"What can I say? This book doesn't reveal much of a surprise but if anything, it shows us to what extent we have tried to normalize the most chaotic and unethical administration. Yes, they will go down in flames and it will be HUGE! SAD!",February-5-2018,5
2194,"Very  interesting information from the ""inside"".  Looking forward to seeing how this all plays out.",March-7-2018,5
2195,interesting reading but did not change my opinion on any political matter .... entertaining the most i can say,March-8-2018,5
2196,"A very good read, but it like almost everything today you have to be smart!",February-9-2018,5
2197,"very interesting. the problem is, Our ""current commander in chief"" creates so many crazy attentions one after the other hat everything is already obsolete shortly after it is published.",February-5-2018,3
2198,"Glad the publishers defied the WH and rushed release of this uneven, but important book.  As so many reviewers note, we Americans are in deep political trouble and itâ€™s worse than we can imagine.  Despite the torrent of typos, bad grammar, made-up words, catty style and dubious sourcing (the reasons for my 3-star rating) this book is worth reading. It peers into the current WH with a wide-angle lense we need to see the chaos, treachery and incompetence operating at our governmentâ€™s highest level.  Healthy stock market portfolios wonâ€™t save us from this MAGA nightmare.One aside:  I was perplexed by Wolffâ€™s frequent and gratuitous slamming of Obama in a tell-all book about 45. The question is how to escape this terrible trap created by a strange confluence of arcane constitutional procedure, a time of troubles for democracy and capitalism globally and an unlikely candidate.  Itâ€™s scary to read how  someone like Bannon, with so little political experience, time and organization, could conjure a win â€œon his first tryâ€ù for a candidate with so many flaws.  Perhaps this book and the higher quality journalism available elsewhere will spur more political activism and a way out for our country.  Hope so.I bought the Kindle edition the day before Wikileaks announced release of a PDF version of this book online. While I would recommend borrowing it from a public library or a friend because logging on to the Wikileaks link would be illegal and a copyright infringement, as I understand it, the book's free release means that means F&F; is available to any reader of English regardless of location or income level if you want to take the risk.  I would not spring for the hard copy.  Itâ€™s perverse that the book is making a brash, but average journalist so rich while 45 gets more attention, which he craves.  Who loses?  We all do.",January-20-2018,3
2199,"If you like uncorrborated political gossip, this book is for you. If you live in reality, it's painful to read and even more painful to think that this ridiculous account was inspired by a real elected Commander in Chief. Ugh and gross.",April-7-2018,3
2200,I think Wolff tried to be objective and to document what was happening in the White House during this time.,January-31-2018,5
2201,"It verified the ""trumpisms"" that made the news and provided the backstory on the White House interactions. But it became very repetitive in blaming Trump and the 3 main competing factions trying to control him. No real new insights or details provided.",January-15-2018,3
2202,The book revealed that the worst that had been whispered about this White House is probably all true. There isn't much more to Trump than what you see. The chaos and incompetence is real.,January-7-2018,4
2203,"Holy moly, this one is a doozy. Like a train wreck that you can't help but watch to the bloody end.",March-10-2018,5
2204,"I read it for the information it gives, but I have to say that this man should get a ghost writer.  He does not write very well, and there are a lot of spelling and grammatical errors in the book (which drives me nuts!)",February-6-2018,4
2205,The dialog inside the white house is like a bad sitcom. I'm reading Cass Sunstein's book on impeachment now. https://www.amazon.com/Impeachment-Citizens-Cass-R-Sunstein/dp/0674983793/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1523861742&sr;=8-3&keywords;=cass+sunstein,April-15-2018,5
2206,We have a president with no regard and evidentally no knowledge of our constitution.  Thanks Michael Wolff for a well researched and well written book. It should scare us all!,January-6-2018,5
2207,"Next step - film adaptation. This needs to be made into a docudrama ASAP. It would be absolutely delicious if Alec Baldwin provided narration. Considering the yuuuge tantrum Cheetolini is throwing about this book, it should be completely head exploding for him to see it turned into a film. First amendment, Trumplethinskin - read it and weep.",January-6-2018,5
2208,"Pretty dry reading.  Some interesting stuff, but a lot was repetitive.  Proves what I already thought of #45.Hard to believe Wolff was allowed to observe and document all this.",January-21-2018,3
2209,"In depth views of the constant upheaval of the Trump campaign, transition and presidency. Who's running circus Trump, find out in this must read.",January-16-2018,5
2210,Really enjoyed the insider look at the chaos and wish someone was still there keeping us informed,March-13-2018,5
2211,"I am loving this book.  I don't know how much is actually true, but I think Wolff has given it some thought as to how to be fair and accurate as a journalist.  I don't believe this is fake news, but I'm sure Mr. Trump and his administration would take issue with it.",February-4-2018,5
2212,"Taken with a large grain of salt, the book provides some juicy color to the past eighteen months of news.",February-27-2018,3
2213,"Shows the chaos and slam-bam of present ""admistration. Wolff shows it like it is.",April-21-2018,4
2214,"Like so many other reviewers, I didnâ€™t plan to read this book; however, I was intrigued by our presidentâ€™s reaction to it. I downloaded the kindle version yesterday and finished the book this afternoon-itâ€™s definitely a page turner. Even though I have followed whatâ€™s happened this year, I never found myself skimming pages to get to more interesting material. His perceptions along with the attributions were fascinating. Wolffâ€™s narrative was not only very engaging, and insiteful but at the same time laugh out loud funny and also managed to scare the bejesus outta me. The number of back stabbing incidents within the White House would rival the entire body of Shakespeare and make The Godfather look tame. Very entertaining! I highly recommend it.",January-7-2018,5
2215,This was an insightful book on not only Donald Trump but also the people that come and go out of his enter circle,January-20-2018,5
2216,"A great read even if some or all are opinions, itâ€™s like being there, inside the wired world of Trump.",February-25-2018,5
2217,"Arrived timely. Got a rebate for price drop. I still cannot suffer through to the end of the book, as the plot (which I knew in advance) is nauseating. I slog through a chapter now and then, and think about moving to a different plane.",April-8-2018,4
2218,I bought this book for one reason....because ugly orange didnâ€™t want me to.,January-7-2018,5
2219,Interesting read.  I know some info slightly exaggerated but the juxt of it I think was right on the money.,February-9-2018,4
2220,This is a fun book to read. The author develops the characters well and then just lets them go. Almost as hilarious as a Hiasson novel. So much has happened since the book's end. Wish there was more!,February-3-2018,5
2221,This book didnâ€™t provide much information that had not already been available to the public via a variety of media sources. The information that was not provided was easily obtained by reading between the lines of all of the public info! There were no surprises!! Trump couldnâ€™t organize a trip to the zoo!,February-20-2018,3
2222,I was definitely not disappointed with this book--raw and pointed opinions captured in this book.,March-13-2018,5
2223,"We knew the White House was dysfunctional, and that Trump was unqualified.  But the story here goes way beyond dysfunctional.  Itâ€™s really told from Bannonâ€™s point of view, a man who seems Trump-like in being unable to keep his mouth shut.",February-25-2018,4
2224,"Itâ€™s all about Donald Trumpâ€™s â€œWhitehouse,â€ù what more can I say?  The quality of writing (grammar, punctuation, etc) is less than professional, but who cares?  Itâ€™s the content thatâ€™s counts, which makes this book ideal for those times when you really could use a good laugh!!",April-7-2018,5
2225,It tells us what we already knew about this fake president. This POTUS is such an embarrassment to our country.,March-7-2018,5
2226,Mainly purchased it to tick off Trump.  Several of my teacher friends and I ordered it just to help it jump to the top of the (failing) New York Times Best Seller List.  Best investment of the year!I'll be reading it while on spring break on a plane.  Can't wait to see what really happens in the White House.,February-19-2018,5
2227,"Michael Wolfe is quite simply and excellent, riveting, and unconstitutional writer.  Abraham A. Held",January-16-2018,5
2228,Entertaining.... elect a child with far too much 'past' and 'baggage' and this is what you get,April-14-2018,5
2229,My book has a flaw from the printer.  Page 163/164 is torn and a good portion of the page is missing.  Unfortunately I did not check the book when it first arrived so I am stuck with it.  Be sure to flip through the pages when your book arrives.,March-20-2018,3
2230,"Entertaining, informative and at times distressing.  Even taking portions of the narrative with a grain of salt, the entire situation is disturbing.",March-13-2018,5
2231,Terrific book for the times. Brought more focus and light on this dark administration.,March-23-2018,5
2232,An interesting X-ray of the Trump initial 12 months. White House  factions colliding playing with the future of the US and the world.,February-8-2018,3
2233,"Great book, must read particularly for Trump fans. Learn the truth.",January-11-2018,5
2234,"Incredible book ! As I am reading it slowly, so many of the persons mentioned keep popping up daily on the news - either they have been fired, or forced to resign or are facing criminal charges.The words "" impeachment ""  and ""madness""  will no doubt will soon appear as the last pages are turned.Reminds me of the Watergate madness",March-7-2018,5
2235,"An excellent, informative and easily read book that ties together many of the weird Trumpian episodes that we were already aware of but hadn't necessarily thought to link together. For instance, Trump's treatment of Roger Ailes just before his death and his refusal to call Beth Ailes just after is similar to how Trump reacted when he found out that his mentor Roy Cohn had Aides. It is these broad strokes found throughout the book that helps make it essential for some kind of understanding of Trump as President.",January-18-2018,5
2236,"If Archie Bunker had the power of the presidency...and Meathead and Gloria were his top advisors...and Dingbat was married to him, but lived in the other room, never had sex with him, and hated him...and he had a consensual relationship with a porno star...oh, well, Iâ€™m going to stop...that could never happen...",January-27-2018,5
2237,"An entertaining chronicle of details behind the chaotic tragedy we see playing out in our nation's capitol.  Offers no insight as to how we might correct the problems, but I didn't expect any.  The revealed actions of the various personalities are consistent with the public view we have of them, so I don't doubt their veracity.",March-21-2018,5
2238,Well written in a documentary style but with a point of view. Just confirms the chaos in the White House and the self-serving participants in the biggest political scam ever perpetrated on the American people...with their unwitting help.,January-14-2018,4
2239,I firmly believe that you hit the nail on the head with the chaos created by the so-called president.  One can only hope that Mueller will bring forth every lurid detail of the worst president ever.  Thank you for writing this book.,March-9-2018,4
2240,This wonderful book will be hailed as the straw that broke the stupid camelâ€™s back.,January-8-2018,5
2241,An inside look into the chaos and disarray of an administration that didn't want to be elected.,March-8-2018,5
2242,"The book reveals just how ignorant Trump is about history, science, the Constitution and what powers he has as president.  He is a con man who convinced voters he would make their lives better.  His bully tactics may have helped him build a real estate empire, but it is not working for him as POTUS.  George Washington could never tell a lie.  Donald Trump can never tell the truth.",January-11-2018,4
2243,"I expected that this book would be compelling reading, but was disappointed. Some incidents and events are already common knowledge. There is enough substance in the book, however, that render it interesting. President Trump has said it time and again that he loves conflict, confrontation and even war. That seems to be the driving force of this book.",March-7-2018,3
2244,"Good fast read. Came off as entirely plausible stuff. A soap opera on steroids, which is what this presidency is. Good fun, if it were not a tragedy.",February-28-2018,5
2245,"I thought the book was interesting,  but not sure how reliable some of he sources were. I have nothing else to add.",February-19-2018,4
2246,Insights hold up still now and very enlightening regarding the ongoing chaos and very entertaining quick read!,March-4-2018,5
2247,"Pretty much as expected, given all we have heard on TV; good read if you are a never Trumpster.",March-7-2018,4
2248,"Unique insight into the perceived and now confirmed intense limitations of this President. After all he wasnâ€™t supposed to win,  but he did and it would appear the country is worse for it. It might be an idea if a book like this comes out at the end of each of this Presidents years in office.We can then remember what the result is when people donâ€™t exercise their right to vote.",February-21-2018,4
2249,"Good job at a bizarre topic, thorough, which again, must have been a challenge.",February-24-2018,3
2250,"I only bought this because Trump tried to stop it -- this ""president"" does NOT tell me what I can or can't read. I don't even care if the contents are 100% false. I'm exercising our constitutional right of freedom of speech and press. That being said, I def believe the contents of this is true since it only mirrors the horrors we've seen about Trump on Twitter and the news.",January-10-2018,5
2251,"OkI donâ€™t normally read political opinion books like this, that emerge during a presidential term that is still in operation, but Michael Wolfe is a good writer and the advance commentary drew me inIf you follow the news already there isnâ€™t that much new in reading the book but for putting the amazing pieces into context and sequence with other events.Iâ€™m confident some of the details presented in the book are speculation and hyperbole - exaggerated by the author. Even so, Iâ€™ve been following US politics closely since late 2016, and itâ€™s the COLLECTION of stories set against the timeline, set against what Iâ€™ve witnessed turning up as reports in the news.Abstract individual stories - the cheeseburgers in bed for example - sound out there, but line them all up and itâ€™s clear that collectively this book hits the mark more often than it may miss.Summary: this doesnâ€™t read or feel like a collection of BS; it has a real ring of â€˜yeah, this is legitâ€™Itâ€™s no candidate for a Pulitzer Prize, but who cares? The book is hilarious on its own, that itâ€™s even come out so soon and so juicy is a sign that the US perception of transparency and democracy - ah huh - is still there, and that the best form of resistance is happening, by the people and for the people (and of course, mr Wolfeâ€™s bank account is pretty flush too Iâ€™m sure).Sadly, Iâ€™m also confident there will be no more such books as this administration is going to go full Underwood to try and build a veneer of â€˜integrityâ€™.Really recommend, but donâ€™t wait to buy; in 6 months this book will have been well superseded by events. QED: false middle alert for Hawaii on 15/1/18. That should make most people freeze with what can ACTUALLY happen",January-16-2018,5
2252,"So far, sooooooooooo good.  I was raised by a mother like Trump and the behavior is too (unfortunately) familiar.",January-10-2018,5
2253,"Pacy, revealing, opinionated and unputdownable, if this book does not rid the USA of Trum, nothing will.",January-23-2018,4
2254,Excellant read,January-27-2018,5
2255,"Interesting and informative book. Although Wolff's sentence structure can sometimes work against the flow of the narrative, I really liked this book.",March-21-2018,4
2256,Very interesting read.  I majored in history in college and this book is a first.  To be inside the White House talking with key players as things are happening and putting it down on paper.  This not only lets the American people know whatâ€™s going on but will be a treasure trove for historians.,March-7-2018,5
2257,"I chose this rating to keep the book in bestseller list. It was an interesting read, bit too exhausting though.",January-15-2018,5
2258,"Fascinating read. A real page-turner. I haven't been impressed with his interviews, but he's a very good writer.",March-1-2018,5
2259,Interesting read.,February-9-2018,5
2260,Very will written with wonderful context and insight. I would recommend to anyone that is interested in understanding the inner working of the current White House. Many sections were riveting and jaw dropping.,March-8-2018,5
2261,"Enjoyed this book very much.  Interested to see if history will prove many of Wolff's assertions to be true.  He never really wanted to be President. He just wanted to try to expose a corrupt system. He got more than he bargained for,",January-20-2018,5
2262,"Excellent reportage.  A canny, narcissistic, egomaniac in the White House close to the nuclear button.",March-20-2018,5
2263,"Superb writing style.  Informative and entertaining, this book gave me further insight regarding individuals that I felt differently about.I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting the back story of many of our most infamous (current/former) political officials.",April-12-2018,5
2264,"MUST READ, then you'll understand what's going on, and see how WH now has become another Sh##H0L# in a beautiful country US of A... sad",February-27-2018,5
2265,Buying this book and giving it a five start rating gives me a tiny bit of satisfaction of sticking it to that man.,February-17-2018,5
2266,Excellent book that tells facts and is not too opinionated. It raises more questions than answers like a proper book should do.,April-21-2018,5
2267,"This the best book I have ever read. Wow, such depth and candor.Glad to now know what really is happening.Very good writing.",March-14-2018,5
2268,"Gossipy political book which raises a few questions, but no question as to the low, low point that our country reached under President Trump.  You get the feeling that we haven't yet hit the bottom and leaves you wondering whether the US can ever recover from it fall from grace and respect.",March-7-2018,3
2269,This book needs to be read.  By everyone!!!,February-12-2018,5
2270,"Inside scoop is just like we thought only more dysfunctional. Palace intrigue exposed and itâ€™s not pretty or clever, but it is sometimes amusing and astounding.",February-25-2018,4
2271,"Breathtaking, shocking, fun, and ultimately tragic, this book is a must read for the American citizen.Read it now, before the show / movie comes out!",January-20-2018,5
2272,This book confirmed everything I would have expected of Mr. Trump.  Bannon is much smarter than he appears to be.,January-23-2018,5
2273,"An outstanding chronological account of an ignorant, mentally deranged tyrant who is bent on dismantling our free society. Apparently his base is not swayed by this book. And, that should scare all rational people on this planet.",March-19-2018,5
2274,"I had already drawn many conclusions about the President, just by reading his tweets and watching his news conferences.  But I tried to approach this book with an open mind.  I think the most important point about the book, is that it verified everything that has been publicly demonstrated by 45.  As a man who embodies the most respectful and important office of government, he cannot OR will not control himself, even IF the office of President itself, demands respect and duty.  Iâ€™m so disappointed.  Iâ€™m planning on contacting all my congressional officials to ask that they protect THE OFFICE of the President, and quit allowing the man whoâ€™s in that office, full reign to bring down the office.  Read the book - even if for the fact that you, as an American have the right to read it!",January-14-2018,5
2275,Reminds me of the Enron book. Still too early to tell when it will all end. Lost some steam in the last 4 chapters.,January-13-2018,5
2276,This is what is running this once great country of ours! A true insider look at the West Wing.,March-3-2018,5
2277,"I bought the digital copy with audio making it easier to get through, it's very well written and informative in case you missed out on all the drama in the WH.  You will get a recap of the past news headlines with the details of the facts and indebts of the events leading up to the election and after the ""bomb shell"" of having an uneducated and uninformed man to be the president of America.  After reading this book and grasping the unveiling facts of the ""Make America Great Again,"" All who are privileged to live on the soil of the United States of America, can pray that the end will be an era of a well embraced PRESCRIPTION.  For as a nation, we must begin to reclaim our minds from a political enemy. Know that he won't easily give up the place that he's had. You will have to do battle against his lies and confusion. You must declare out loud that you will not allow any outside force to do your thinking. Thanks Michael Wolff, well done. God Bless America.",February-11-2018,5
2278,"Enthralling and candid behind the scenes look at the campaign & first 200 days, but the writing style is a bit too hyperbolic.  The characters & their actions are clearly over-the-top, so a more ""documentarian"" style would have been appreciated and served to illustrate how ridiculous they actually are.",January-18-2018,4
2279,Enjoyable reading about a very disturbing White House.  I think you'll find some interesting insights...believe me.,February-20-2018,4
2280,"Loved it, but by the time I could read it, I'd heard excerpts with all the juicy parts on TV....",February-20-2018,5
2281,Was a interesting read . More like a gossip magazine than a historical account . I enjoyed it .,March-7-2018,4
2282,Really enjoyed this book. Easy reading and very entertaining. Highly recommend!,April-19-2018,5
2283,Very interesting and a little scary.  My brain still canâ€™t figure out how it all happened.  Good read.,March-8-2018,5
2284,"As expected, this book truly demonstrates what an idiot we have running the country. Ugh. There have been complaints that some of the material in it is undocumented. That hardly matters. If just HALF of what Wolff reports is true, our democracy is being led by a complete incompetent.",February-3-2018,5
2285,"Even though a lot of what is in the book has been speculated upon it is still interesting to read about the dysfunction that engulfs White House.  In general one side effect of all of Trump's blusters, insults, Tweeting and lies isâ€‹ that we as a country are starting to become numb to it all.  We can't let that happen, he has to be held accountable.  I don't buy let Trump be Trump, it doesn't solve anything.",January-13-2018,4
2286,really good book,January-10-2018,5
2287,"I read it twice... the first time for all the excitement and the second time to actually discover something useful. The book is entertaining, occasionally astounding, and usually predictable... snarky little people bad mouthing the even littler defective man running my country into the ground. It did reinforce my detestation factor, encourage my continued active resistance to Mr. Trump's  Presidency, and make me feel smart about myself for recognizing Mr.Trump is a mad man before it was commonly agreed upon... although i suspect my shaded opinion was greatly shared in private.. .",March-7-2018,3
2288,"It's bananas.  I was already ashamed that America voted for this clown (not really, since he lost by 3 million votes), but this book shoots my shame into the stratosphere.  This has to become an Amazon Prime TV series when he is deposed (or dies of fast food poisoning).",March-14-2018,5
2289,"Poor writing mechanics, but fascinating topic. Page-turner, worth the $.",January-30-2018,4
2290,Interesting read. As with all books read with an open mind. Albeit there seems to be a lot of chaos in the White House currently; this book details much of what he saw during his invited time into the inner workings of the White House. Very good read.,March-8-2018,4
2291,Confirmed what reporters had reported all along. It was like reliving the ugly all over again. Sad.,March-7-2018,5
2292,Liked a lot may have some factual errors but I believe the overall picture he paints is accurate.,February-14-2018,4
2293,I purchased this for my husband.  He thought it 90% accurate.,January-29-2018,4
2294,"I bought this book because I wanted to ""stick it to""  Trump.  I hate that he always threatens to sue those whom he dislikes (e.g. claimants of sexual harassment by him).However, the book is very readable and ""all of the good stuff"" in it has NOT been reported.  One could fault a lack of some documentation, however, the fact is virtually all of the claims made do fit the public persona of Trump and are quite believable.Read it if you love Trump (but you'll be angry) or hate him (schadenfreude).

2296,I dislike Donald Trump so much I just had to buy the book and keep it on the best seller list.,February-22-2018,5
2297,"This is a fascinating/horrifying story, and I could barely put it down. Some of those quoted in the book are saying they were mis-quoted by the author. However, the overall story of Trump's chaotic style matches my own perception based on what Trump himself has publicly said and written. It really is a frightening picture, and I'm glad the book has led to further questioning of key figures in the book as well as discussion by the American public.  I do wish Wolff had been careful about making any factual errors at all, no matter now small, because then some people tend  to disbelieve everything in the book. I also wish Wolff had used a clearer writing style. He prefers very long sentences with multiple subordinate clauses and some words I didn't know. I personally like learning new words, and I'm a highly intelligent person with a masters degree, so if these quirks of the author bothered me, they probably bother other readers more. When you have a riveting story, why litter the path through your story with so many boulders?",January-17-2018,5
2298,"As Smooth Sluggo said, ""His supporters will cry foul, and say some of it isn't true -- and some of it might not be -- but if even 10% of what is in this book is true, holy crap!""",January-17-2018,5

2306,Full of sound and fury signifying nothing. I was curious about it. I managed to get about 50 pages into the book before I became bored. It sits on the shelf gathering dust and will go into the recycling bin in due season.,March-16-2018,3

2310,The book was interesting.,January-10-2018,4
2311,"Whether you like Trump or not, this administration is a fascinating mix of oddball characters and competing agendas. Wolff offers inside commentary on what has gone in this past year, and while I've seen reports of some inaccuracies, I have found it to put much of the insanity into perspective. An enjoyable read for anyone interested in what currently passes for our nation's leadership.",March-7-2018,5

2320,"I am vehemently against Trump.  This book, while a bit too long, confirms everything I ever thought, read or heard about him.

2330,"I actually lost interest about halfway through the book.  It is insightful into the turmoil and politics inside the White House, but it feels like the author makes too many inferences about people's feelings and motivations.  He also seems intent on impressing us with his broad knowledge of the English vocabulary; using a lot of words that the average person needs to look up to understand.  Also, the occasional typo that slipped through makes it look like it was rushed to press without proper proofreading.",March-7-2018,3

2345,"First off, trump has no business being president. This book merely reinforces my opinion. Wolff gives a synopsis of the first few months of this presidency and the dysfunction in the White House.

Although that stopped soon, so I assume that there is enough audio material to back up the statements made in te book. Very good read with several interesting points not prior mentioned in the press..",February-8-2018,5

2355,"I found it sort of hard to read...like it was published quickly and not edited as well as the author would have liked.  But, given the subject, understandable.  The book was fascinating and I found it credible.  Itâ€™s the 5th book Iâ€™ve read on Trump and I noticed some events and how they played out was in line with what others have written about him.  Very scary.",March-4-2018,4
2356,I loved it. It was gossipy and certainly not entirely accurate or completely factual. Clearly some informants had axes to grind and vendettas to execute (looking at you Steve Bannon)â€”but that is sort of the point. It provides a delicious look inside a chaotic/dysfunctional White House. In that sense it is probably truthful in essence.,March-7-2018,5

2362,Meh!  Read like a newspaper article. I must say  though it was an intriguing behind the scenes look at Trump WH -- disappointing that it is such a madhouse!  What has America done to itself?!  Trump must be furious,March-29-2018,3

2364,This review is being written in March of 2018.  The book came out in December.  There are some factual errors in the book but the overall picture the  book gives matches exactly what has been going on in the White House.  Highly recommended.,March-7-2018,5
2365,A great read. Provides a terrific inside look into the early chaotic Trump White House and the main characters that got him there. An interesting discussion about the interactions between these people as well as their individual motivations and goals.,May-1-2018,5
2366,Having a difficult time reading the print as the print is small and the ink is light.,February-22-2018,3
2367,Very informative and it supported my worst fears but I also fear that the author relied nearly 100% on the observations of Steve Bannon and his observations cannot be viewed as impartial. Also the author's prose was somewhat ponderous. I also needed a French to English dictionary close at hand because of his frequent use of French expressions which I did not understand (my fault for not being literate with French).,February-4-2018,3

2396,"Well, I can say that it was a fun read.  I have no idea how accurate it is as far as the purported quotes go.  I didn't learn anything that I didn't hear from other sources, but it was still a quick and easy read.  It would have been more enjoyable, however, if it was able to end with Trump and his gang winding up in prison.  Oh well, you can't have everything I guess.",January-22-2018,4

2398,"The minute I heard that the WH had tried to block its publication, I downloaded a copy via Kindle. As many reviewers have already mentioned, I have noticed the grammar errors in the Kindle version. If you can get over that, it makes an interesting read.  There is not a lot of new material here. That being said, it is still kind of shocking to take it all in under one cover rather then the constant drip, drip, drip that has come out on the cable news channels and Twitter over the past year.",January-8-2018,5

2418,"Act I: Snatching Victory from the Jaws of DefeatAlthough Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon had quietly predicted a Trump victory, no one, including them, believed it would actually happen. In fact, to a man, even before the electoral college votes were counted, team trump was already making a virtue out of necessary by completing their resumes and preparing to â€œcash-inâ€ù on taking the lost gracefully, wishing only that it not be a complete â€œblow-out.â€ù But then the impossible happened: Trump won!Act II: Setting up the Organizational Chart: A Trump/Mercer thingIn the waning days of the campaign, the financing got really dicey, and quickly began to go sideways. This was due primarily to Trump seeing a sure lost in the offing, balked on continuing his pledge to self-finance. This hesitation during the stretch run, left the back door open for the ultra-rightwing billionaires, Rebeka and Robert Mercer to jump in at the last minute; rescue the Trump operation; and set themselves up to extract a price from Trump for being the campaignâ€™s saviors.When he did in fact win, the Mercerâ€™s found themselves in â€œthe cat bird seat:â€ù They had hit the mega-lottery. The price for being Trumpâ€™s financial saviors, at least on the surface, appeared to be relatively cheap. It was only to have Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon added to Trumpâ€™s first-string White House roster.Having no political experience, or even friends to provide political advice, beyond Rudy Guiliani and Chris Christie, Trump simply had no choice but to accept the Mercersâ€™ subtle fait accompli. Thus, in the opening days of the Trump administration, Conway and Bannon, plus the trump family, was the Trump first-string team.The initial organizational chart consisted of five components. The first, and arguably the most important, was â€œthe message to the mediaâ€ù component. Weaponizing the Tweetersphere would become Trumpâ€™s forte. He enlisted Conway to back him up in this endeavor by making her the face of the administration to the media.The second component was the ideology and policy formulation component. Even though Trump would have a revolving door set of Chiefâ€™s of staff, owing to Trumpâ€™s lack of political knowledge and expertise, directing policy strategy was an area reserved for, and left almost exclusively to, Steve Bannon. With only occasional and loose Trump oversight via late night consultations, Bannon would rule this area like it was his own private fiefdom â€” almost completely unchallenged â€” until, that is, overreach caused his downfall.Finally, there was the bureaucratic component, which made up the rest of the organizational chart. It involved the Chief of Staff work; the liaison work of interacting and communicating with the Congress, Department heads, civic organizations and indeed with the rest of the world â€” as well as carrying out the operational tasks of scheduling, speech-writing, and making the trains run on time.This component sat between what used to be called â€œgovernmental institutionsâ€ù and the â€œswamp-draining 45th US President.â€ù At least through the first year, this last component would remain a grab bag left fallow, eventually being picked up by a revolving door of assorted second-string recruits, whose only employment requirements were that they: (1) not appear smarter than their boss, and (2) that they demonstrate undying loyalty and respect for him and his family. Coupled with keeping the family secrets shielded from public scrutiny while pretending to be unaware that the family was busy using government to increase the family wealth, these two requirements were exactly the same as for everyone else.Act III: Implementing Policy: The War of the IncompetentsBeneath the organization chart, two primary competing power centers had formed: Ivanka and Jared versus Bannon. By design, the lines of authority had been blurred enough that the only thing certain was that they all led directly to Trump, and that he remained unchallenged in the clock tower on the 26th floor of Trumpâ€™s Fifth Avenue building. From there, and from Mar a Largo, as much as from the West Wing, Trump mediated all disputes and made decisions by rarely seeking counsel from anyone other than himself.Predictably, this environment turned into organizational chaos, quickly devolving further into all-out internecine warfare between competing micro-fiefdoms. The weapon of choice for all combatants was self-righteous, whiny back-biting leaks to the press.Arguably, since he at least had some policy experience, and always seemed on the same ideological wave length as Trump, Bannon had the upper hand in these struggles. However, realizing that he had an enviable advantage, from the start Bannon pressed this advantage too far, ending up repeatedly playing his hand badly. Hated by everyone because of his gruffness, his sloppiness and his haughty â€œholier than thouâ€ù ideological purity posturing and attitude, in which he never passed up an opportunity to make clear that he was the sharpest knife in the drawer, Bannon overreached: Somehow he thought he could use his advantage to â€œbullyâ€ù the Trump family itself into bending to his will?So long as he knew his place, and stayed in his lane, Trump allowed Bannon to do so. But the Trumps all nervously watched him like a hawk, giving him just enough rope to hang himself, which Bannon eventually did, three times in fact before he was finally exiled and put to death for good.Heavy-handed, Bannon, like Trump, did not deal in subtlety or nuance, and inevitably tried to drive a wedge between Trump and Jarvanka, going so far as to urge Trump to get his own daughter and son-in-law out of the White House? But here he had grossly overplayed his hand the final time: The Trumps closed ranks, and Steve was toast.Act IV: Special Prosecutor: The Beginning of the endTo say that the Trump brand was a complicated business affair, would be a monument to understatements. Trump had made his bones as a highly visible New York Real Estate Mogul. Financially he had been up and down so many times that it was difficult to determine whether he was in fact a multi-billionaire or once again on the edge of bankruptcy. The only thing certain was that no one could be allowed to tamper with his brand, or know what he was really worth, or what he and his family was really up to? And for these he needed protection.Not fully understanding how government worked, Trump went about the business of acquiring protection by breaking all the furniture and rules of institutional power. His technique was right out of The Godfather playbook: Bring in the people from competing governmental institutions, so that they can run interference for the Trump empire, by pledging their undying loyalty only to him personally.In this regard, he had some initial success with the CIA, the first step in finding protection. However, Bannon had warned him not to try the same tactics with the FBI. When he clumsily tried to lean on, and then reel-in Jim Comey of the FBI, Bannon knew that Trump had made a fatal mistake. When Comey balked at Trumpâ€™s crude heavy-handed entreaty, Trump fired him, setting off a mini-firestorm that resulted in the appointment of a much more fearsome threat to the Trump empire and family secrets, a Special Prosecutor, one tasked to look into every nook and cranny of the Trump empire, especially into whether  collusion had occurred with Russia during the election that brought Trump to power; or more importantly, into whether there was something more untoward and fishy in the cozy relationship between Vladimir Putin and Donald John Trump?Act V: The Unravelling of DJTUp to the writing of this book, the author had been given enviable access to the West Wing allowing him to compose this, the first draft of Trump presidential history. However, from the start, what he saw, hanging out on the couch in the lounge of the West Wing, alarmed him.It was not just the knocking over of institutional furniture through gross incompetence, or the hubris, the vicious infighting, or even the unearned sense of entitlement. But there also was something else too â€” something intangible and hard to put oneâ€™s finger on â€” but it was unmistakably there: DJT was beginning to unravel. Whether his unraveling was just continued anxiety and hyper-sensitivity to the potential for further damaging the Trump Brand, or the prospect of uncovering a more sinister financial connection between the Trump empire and Russian intelligence, remains to be proven.As the Special Prosecutorâ€™s investigation inexorably inches closer and closer to the Trump family jewels â€” whatever they my be â€” â€œteam Trumpâ€ù has circled the wagons, lawyered-up, and all are keeping their powder dry for the final onslaught. Will the trump empire survive? ... Stay tuned. Five stars",January-12-2018,5

2429,"some of this is gossipy but there are some valuable insights as well. For example ""Trump in a smart move, picked up his media reputation and relocated it from a hypercritical New York to a more value-free Hollywood, becoming the star of his own reality show, The Apprentice, and embracing a theory that would serve him well during his presidential campaign; in flyover country, there is no greater asset than celebrity""This illuminates his values so effectively for me. He values celebrity, even notoriety over quality. This man would gild Michelangelo's David because then it would be better because it would be gold...and that everything is personal. This is how he can live in a fact-free universe. He decides his feelings about the person (living, dead, fictional real) and then spins his reality from those conclusions.anyway its a worthwhile and fast read",January-24-2018,5

2442,"Thank you Mr. Wolff.  Can't imagine the vitriole that will be levied at you. I'm about 1/3rd through the book and I appreciate your effort.  This is not enjoyable to read, as I keep grimacing, ""...How did we get here, how did we get here.""  But it is consistant with the bits and pieces we already new, and like those bits, the entire book falls into the category, ""You can't make this stuff up.""  I don't want to give the impression there is nothing new here, there is a lot that is new, and a lot that is jaw dropping.  Even if you are a Trump fan, perhaps particularly If you are a fan, or even if you aren't a fan but are thinking it's all about the judges, you might want to give this a read.

Has no grasp of the role of the President and and has a woeful knowledge of history. It is beyond scary that this not very intelligent bullshitter is in charge of the USA. Its no wonder he does not believe in global warming, or civil rights. He is a bigot and a carnival barker. Bravo Wolff!",March-22-2018,5

2452,A bit gossipy but I suspect a very accurate representation of the chaos of the Trump White house. Much of the book is about Stephen Bannon and he is probably one of the major sources.

2453,"I first bought the Audible version, and I completed it over the weekend.  I didn't want it to end.  I then got my hands on the print version and read it carefully to see if the answers to questions that eluded me the first time through were actually therein.  I still want to know:  What was the impact of Ailes' demise on Trump's world?  The extreme focus on Jarvanka and Hope Hicks is  pretty heavy, so is this just Bannon's story-telling or are there in truth other primary culprits who are overlooked in this book?  I'm also still not clear: when did Bannon KNOW that the Russians-Jr. meeting was going on? What is DJT's opinion of Pence? Wolff writes about everyone else's opinion of Pence, but we get no insight into Trump's view (is he a threat? is he a lapdog? will he be short-lived?).  Are the Mercers the ultimate puppet-masters? Is Bannon a ""deep throat"" in plain sight??  I need MORE, MORE, MORE!!My view of DJT is not different after reading this book, but my view of each and every other personality in the campaign and the WH certainly is.  Maybe the one thing that did slightly surprise me about DJT was his awareness early on that his campaign team was a bunch of losers and that many of those people were injected into the campaign by people other than DJT himself.  Yet despite that truth, Wolff seems to echo Bannon's view that Jarvanka -- whom DJT hand-picked -- and the Jarvanka inner circle will be the cause of this president's demise, PERIOD.",January-8-2018,5

That is a poor reason to run for president but more fool us for allowing him to get elected.

2525,"I got this as many others on the release day. The week before was full of leaks and they all seem to be the only true news from the content. This book just confirm what we all know - the Emperor has no cloths. I find the book to lay too much importance to the role of Bannon - if he was a true machiavellian he would have stayed onboard. He should have been more of a Blackadder, than a idealistic visionary. No one cares for dreamers like him no matter how dark his dream is. He seems too driven by the idea that Trump can be the front figure of political movement of change without any substance. Never con a conman. Trump is about Trump - its the whole tragedy and beauty of this time periode. Never has the daily deeds of a Presidents been elevated to be the only news for so long.

2536,I enjoyed it much more than I enjoy the subject of the book.,March-12-2018,4
2537,"Wolffâ€™s gripping tell-all has opened a much-needed window into the workings of the so-called Trump White House (ironically using big words that Trump himself wonâ€™t be able to understand).  Most of the stories weâ€™ve heard before, but Wolff provides fantastic background and context and makes the terror palpable.",January-6-2018,5
2538,"Substantively it is an interesting, not to mention disturbing window on the feckless Trump White House but the poor editing and compulsion towards obscure vocabulary renders it a somewhat annoying read.",January-16-2018,3
2539,Plodding read fails to make critical connections in it's data and bounces all over rather than follow a timeline. The info is good just hard to obtain,March-10-2018,3
2540,This confirmed my worst fears for our country and constitution.,March-19-2018,5
2541,"Not sure every word is a true accounting of what is happening below the surface appearance of things, but the overall perception of chaos rings through loud and clear. Certainly worth the read,",April-6-2018,5

2543,THANK GOD somebody wrote this.  Brilliant.,March-13-2018,5
2544,"I purchased the Kindle version of this. A riveting read thus far! We already know what a buffoon this orange person and his entire administration is, but to see confirmation of it in print and to see examples and accounts of what actually happens in the White House is downright scary. This book is well written and entertaining, although that is countered by constantly cringing when knowing the blatant damage the Dotard is doing to the US, its environment and natural habitats, and the US reputation internationally.",January-6-2018,5
2545,"This book was what I expected.  Reading it is scarier than listening to the news.  Not written very well, but it does get the point across.",February-24-2018,4
2546,"Like a masterpiece painting, if you stand close and dissect the details you may find faults.  But step back and observe the picture in full, you'll see everything rings true and real.  SAD!",January-7-2018,5
2547,"So revealing. However, not much I had not surmised about our President.",February-2-2018,5
2548,"The lack of any stated or implied purpose makes this monotonous read a waste of time and money.  Regardless of whether the author's words are true or false, and there is no way to know, the book is simply boring.  Whether the reader likes or dislikes Donald Trump, it's impossible to avoid coming to the conclusion that the author is a conniving opportunist.  I heard one pundit refer to Wolff as a slime-bucket.  I'll second that.",March-3-2018,2

2552,"Through the book, you as a reader are presented to a timeline from election campaign, through the election and the start-up of the presidency. Regardless of wrong or misleading details, the events organized in cronological order gives you a pretty good impression of Trump's presidency",March-8-2018,4
2553,Clearly written.  Inside portrait of a chaotic White House.,March-7-2018,5
2554,"The book makes the White House administration understandable.  A good read about a president whose behavior is not as surprising as one would otherwise think.  I enjoyed reading it very much, even though I am not a fan of Trump, his family and the others mentioned in the book.",February-15-2018,5
2555,A very informative book that verifies rumors that we all thought were true.,January-14-2018,5

2558,"Many facts in the book were already public. Still, the recounting in chronological order gave a better perspective to the mess that inhabits the White House. My main criticism centers in the authors somewhat jumbled writing style.",January-24-2018,4
2559,"The best way I can describe it:  Micheal Wolff ain't Robert Caro, but DT ain't LBJ.  Better to say  that Wolff writes to the value and strength of his subjects.  Most of these whom seem, well,  none too bright.The story of the mess now makes more sense, but it's still a huge orange mess.",January-8-2018,5
2560,"I pre-ordered this book when Trump said he did not want it published.  What an interesting book!  I knew the white house was dysfunctional with Trump as president so I was not surprised at what I read.  What surprised me was finding out that what was being ""leaked"" to the press and denied by Trump was was actually coming from Trump and his own family.  Even if this book is not 100% accurate, there are enough true things in there to prove that this is the most dysfunctional white house ever.  I highly recommend this book.",January-19-2018,5

2568,Very revealing about the Trump administration and all their missteps.,February-15-2018,5
2569,Was really excited about this at first.  A look inside the white house from an unbiased point of view? Cool!  Then I found out the Author embellished or just made up facts and happenings.  Haven't been able to pick it up since.,March-29-2018,2
2570,"Although I expected Trump was a horrible person based on what he's said publicly, this book cements that and really nails the fact home. He is even worse in private than in public to his peers, family, so-called friends, staff, and apparently everyone around him who isn't named Ivanka. This book is an eye opener on just who the minority of people in the US elected as president, and a sad reflection on where we are as a society as a result. If you want to know what's really going on in the White House, read this, but be prepared to shake your head often, exhale in frustration, and wonder repeatedly why this hateful, misogynistic, philandering, racist man is sitting in the Oval Office.",January-29-2018,5

2572,Wonderful read!  Show just how confused the President and his White is!,January-23-2018,5
2573,A very unflattering view of our President. The fact that this book was even published at all speaks more to the fact of how dysfunctional the current administration is.,January-7-2018,5
2574,It affirms the absurdity of the current White House. If even half of the book is true it makes every dayâ€™s hard to believe stories make sense. It is also validation for how difficult it is to support this president,March-8-2018,4
2575,"I enjoyed the book, it was stuff I had already read.  Plenty of typos",March-8-2018,4
2576,"What's not to like about a lot of juicy gossip about out 'beloved' President? Actually, most of it I knew anyway from watching and listening to the news since his inauguration. Not any actual surprises, except possibly a hint that he has a rather unusually loving relationship with Hope Hicks (who I had never heard of). Like he might be her Svengali? I found the book itself to have been hurriedly written and definitely very poorly edited with many typos for want of a better phrase? An easy read though which I read in two days!",January-23-2018,5
2577,"Loved the content but poorly written. Iâ€™m not a stickler for perfect English but the poorly constructed sentences were hard to follow. Also full of political jargon that I could not always make sense of. However, great smear of this horrible, consummate con artist",March-15-2018,4
2578,Thanks to Michael Wolff for doing the investigative work needed and then writing this book. I have been waiting for a long time to find out what was going on in that chaotic White House.,January-13-2018,5

2581,SO glad to be able to order this for my kindle. It was an eye opening read.,February-8-2018,5
2582,Mildly amusing. I knew the book was mostly BS when Wolff described the Joe and Mika show as centrist. What a joke that was. Don't waste your money. You can see the same stuff on MSNBC for free.,March-19-2018,3
2583,This should be required reading in schools and colleges,April-12-2018,4
2584,"If 1/100th of this is true, the White House is in shambles.  Excellent look into that mess.",March-12-2018,5
2585,Interesting but overkill and repetitive at times.  You're more depressed about the immediate future after reading it.  Liberals will love it.  Trumpers will not read.,January-17-2018,5
2586,TRUMP IS A BIGGER JERK THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE!,March-26-2018,5
2587,An interesting read. Mot usually a political book reader.,March-4-2018,4
2588,interesting read even if only half of it is true.  The most significant information I gleaned from the book was the chaos in the WH.  What is truly amazing is the infighting between the family and cabinet.  The book is well written.  What I liked least is it is scary to think these people are responsible for the executive branch of government.,March-13-2018,4
2589,After a couple of chapters all I could do was just laugh.,March-2-2018,5
2590,Interesting book but very disappointed in our president...,February-27-2018,4
2591,"havent read it yet but I'm sure its great. not feeling like getting angry about this marmalade maniac, i get enough just listening to the news. i at least feel good i supported the book.",April-9-2018,5
2592,"Wolff pulls back the curtain around the White House and shows you the chaos and dysfunction of the current administration. Allot of mud has been thrown at Michael Wolff in an attempt to discredit him. I have read a number of books about Trump well before he got into the White House and this book runs true. Chaos is Trumps modus operandi. Personal attacks, hate, lack of focus, incomprehension of others feelings, these are all Trump traits. Now throw in the alt-right and you have a recipe for disaster. For those who don't get it. History has long shown that some people are put in power as radical reformers in attempts to break old power structures with the hope that their most radical sides can be ameliorated, but these radicals have historically broken their chain's and gone their own way much to the horror of those who put them there. This hurricane has only just started.",February-23-2018,5
2593,I liked it alot,January-18-2018,4

2595,Such a fun and scary read. Well played and well done.,January-6-2018,5
2596,"Overall, I liked the book. While parts of it seemed to be hyperbolic, Michael Wolff gives a clear and unvarnished look at the Trump White House. It was particularly interesting to read about the interplay among the many characters competing for Trump's attention.",March-10-2018,4
2597,Very strange people from top to bottom.,February-7-2018,5
2598,I got quite a few laughs from this book; although it's no laughing matter.,March-7-2018,4

2601,"I have been waiting to read & share this book & its observations. A historic  buy & occasion, read it now.",March-27-2018,5
2602,"Michael Wolff masterfully navigates through the chaos of the most dysfunctional White House in history in his book ""Fire and Fury."" The book is extremely juicy and almost 100% accurate, and there are in my view three major revelations:1. The Air Force One meeting after the June 2016 Trump Tower/Russia meeting as depicted by Wolff is an obstruction of justice directly connected to Trump himself;2. Trump's complete reliance on Kushner/Bannon to run things. Bannon is no longer there; If Kushner gets indicted the entire house of cards collapses;3. Trump's rapidly deteriorating memory; Wolff's depiction is of someone suffering from Alzheimers or some form of frontotemporal lobe dementia.",January-6-2018,5
2603,"This book confirms what I already thought.  We need get Trump out of office as soon as possible.  If we dont, he will do severe damage to our country.  The man is insane.",January-6-2018,5

2614,Fun reading.  Enjoyed the book. Glad with the purchase.,February-28-2018,5
2615,It kept me reading. The best part was seeing where everyone was located when I first saw it on the news. And which side they were on. Family is family is family and that may be the only thing Mr Drumpf has ever really cared about. Well except himself and the almighty dollar bill.  If I hadn't seen this all happen I would say it was all fiction.,January-14-2018,4
2616,"This book is a great read, hard to put down.  I purchased it because of the publicity surrounding it.  The text starts with day one of this presidential administration, and ends with the end of Bannon's time in the White House.If Michael Wolff made these stories up, he has a wonderful imagination because some of the text is spot on.  I would recommend this book just based on the drama.",January-21-2018,5

2621,"You can't write a book like this and not do your research on the subject.  But even if half of the information is true about Mr. Trump and his pals, then we are seriously in trouble.",March-30-2018,5
2622,Interesting Read.,February-5-2018,4
2623,I enjoyed this inside look into the Whitehouse. I feel I better understand the chaos that is still occurring. I think everyone should read this and keep an open mind. Especially the Trump supporters should read about who they have elected. I can only pray the dysfunction ends soon.,February-19-2018,5
2624,"Juicy gossip and innuendo, short on evidence...  like a tell-all magazine, each reader will probably have a different take on the narrative. In this period of chaos, it does seem to explain some things. Lots of ""oh mys"" and ""good Lords""; if even half of this is true, what a mess.",March-31-2018,4
2625,"Although the book had its omg moments, so much could be read as an obviously slanted storyline.  Amazing to think the Trump WH allowed Wolff so much access and freedom.  Author took heavy and serious advantage of obvious amateurs for his own self-serving purpose.  Wolff made a lot of money taking shots at his subjects with his treachery, but his trust-worthiness and journalism career are shot .",March-15-2018,3
2626,"Wow!  This is an eye opening book, and I couldn't put it down!  It certainly explains why our current situation is happening.",February-5-2018,5
2627,"Waited weeks to get this book, and wished I'd never ordered it at all.  Tedious reading, nothing really new, and I wondered if Michael Wolff was ever acquainted with the sentiment, ""Keep it simple......Stupid!!""",March-19-2018,2

2629,What a mess!,February-22-2018,5
2630,"This book was disappointing. Not nearly as exciting as people made it out to be. Why it sold like it did is beyond me. You want a really good book, read 'The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump'. THAT was a good book.",April-1-2018,2

2633,"The details in this book are what make it so good. Although I knew most of the topics and information; the extra detail Wolff includes are the most deleterious sections giving that little extra glimpse into a very ineffective, ill-equipped, uncouth, inexperienced, disrespectful and dare I say, most Un-American admiration EVER! Mr. Wolff congrats on your best seller!",January-19-2018,5

2637,"Wolff may just be the Herodotus of our time - get the other side view of history, gain the oral history. There is also a great deal of anthropology like description within. Sure, it's salacious, but it's facts are obvious and it is written with panache. Still reading, it is just that good. Cheers to the First Amendment and here's hoping for a new year where this national nightmare ends.",January-6-2018,5
2638,Great book get the truth inside the trump administration,February-13-2018,5

2641,"A rehash of all that has been written about the present administration, but put together in a timely, coherent fashion.  It just reinforces everything we have read.  It is entertaining though.",March-11-2018,3
2642,The stories are nothing we haven't heard IF we've been paying attention.  What I found especially interesting was the details of all the chaos and backstabbing that went on to get Trump's approval and trust.  Nobody in this cabinet has a clue what they are doing and certainly no idea of how to do what they should.  IT'S SCARY to think this man is in office to make major decisions to keep the country safe.  I'm sure his supporters will not read this book because they are still in denial but to the rest of us who have been closely following the news and events YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS UP and you certainly cannot deny it.Michael Wolff did an outstanding job putting all this in print and in detail.  He painted a perfect picture of incompetency and coverup of this administration.  I highly recommend reading this and please-please VOTE!,January-24-2018,4

2644,Great book !,February-8-2018,5
2645,"Just got through 100 pages of this book. Well written book. What an amazingly entertaining and soil your pants frightening book. To think this man has at his disposal the ability to end the world with a press of a few buttons. It's worse than people know. I recommend you read it even for pure comic amusement. Impeach or 25, this treasonous piece of garbage! In the meantime I will try to enjoy watching him being slowly crucified by his enemies in the Intel community, congress, media and his own administration whom he disrespected as the leaks to media continue. He was warned. GOD, HONOR AND COUNTRY! and to hell with the enemies of our democracy.",January-5-2018,5

2647,Remember that time we all happily paid to watch that dumb movie about North Korea that the mad man tried to keep anyone from seeing? The fact that he tried to bully them into keeping this book from us is all the more reason to buy it.,January-9-2018,5

2651,"Unbelievablely interesting.  While lacking solid attribution for most of the theories propounded by the Staffers and people close to Don, this book provides a very telling insight into the declining mind of a supposed world leader.  The Trumperor truly has no clothes, thanks to the author's extraordinary work.  Will this book make the Presidential Library?",January-23-2018,5
2652,"My husband loves it. He thinks the writing, and details are amazimg",March-20-2018,4
2653,"If Donald Trump were a fictional character in Fire and Fury (and oh, how I wish he were), he would not be the evil villain, plotting to take down the world. Rather, he would be an accidental and self-absorbed bumbler on the world stage, never hoping or even expecting to ascend to the presidency. And therein lies the tragedy.Donald Trump ran for one reason and for one reason only: to build his brand and to position himself as the most famous person on earth (the antithesis of Crooked Hillary). No one, least of all Trump, (with the exception of Steve Bannon), expected a victory.  Hence, no one prepared.  If youâ€™re wondering â€“ as I have â€“ why easy targets like Flynn and Manafort were around, the answer is simple: Trump never vetted anyone because he never expected that heâ€™d need to.In the void left by a disinterested commander in chief, three forces combat to win the soul of the presidency: Steve Bannon who is a proponent of anarchy â€“ tearing down everything and then rebuildingâ€_Rance Preibus, the voice of traditional Republicansâ€_and Javanka, otherwise known as Jared and Ivanka, who, given their druthers, would push their relative into becoming a Rockefeller Democrat. In the push-pull that follows, an atmosphere of extreme distrust follows as each of these factions leaks on the other two.Yet the one who is most effective in getting to Trump is Ivanka, who learned the formula at an early age: do not befuddle him with data and PowerPoint presentations, use emotive visuals whenever possible, and flatter his wisdom. The Syria bombing following the internal chemical attack? Ivanka showed her father photos of the victims, which spurred him to act, in ways that the others could not make him do.Trump is a weasly fellow, disloyal to everyone in his life (including Javanka), possessing just the shell of a marriage, likely having an affair with one of his underlings, unable to focus, and totally uninterested in anything that doesnâ€™t directly affect himself and his brand. He is the self-professed billionaire who canâ€™t read a balance sheet, the champion of Christianity who has broken just about every commandment, the fair-weather friend, and the most unlikely occupant the White House has ever seen.I closed this book amazed that in the past year, our government has functioned at all under his â€œleadership.â€ù And I continue to be dismayed that America has lost its way, preferring charismatic celebrities to perhaps boring but eminently qualified candidates who actually have given deep thought to our myriad of problems.Donâ€™t choose this book expecting to find a Doris Goodwin or Jon Meacham meticulous analysis of Trump and his misadventures, or even any answers to whether he colluded with Russia or not. Do select it if you are seeking sometimes salubrious and often spot-on psychological insights into the saddest chapter ever of American politics",January-23-2018,5
2654,I gave the book as a gift to my son....I know he will enjoy it.  Arrived on time and in perfect shape.I hope to borrow it so I can settle in and read what seems to be an interesting read.,February-4-2018,5

2658,Great read!,April-26-2018,5
2659,"A very interesting account of an obviously troubling White House. However, Mr. Wolff would have been better served not to use language that the average American would find frustrating in comprehending.  It definitely took away from the flow and enjoyment of the read.I didn't find too much in this book that I had not already known from other sources but it refreshed my memory of certain eventsRecommended for those who do not utilize multiple sources for balanced information.",April-4-2018,3

2686,"Michael Wolff's writing style is condensed, summative and not really in the format of a history book or strict journalism text but designed to give an overview with explicit examples and comments. I would say this reads like each chapter is a lengthy Vanity Fair article. I would have liked to have seen more direct quotes from the various people he interacted with, but the ones in the book are desultory, vivid and sometimes laugh out loud funny. The story and people he discusses are in the news quite often along with the scandals, so the back story to many of these provides a shocking and wild portrait of dangerously stupid back stabbers, Brown Nosers, amateurs and stunningly idiotic individuals running amok in the West Wing.  In a few places in the book I did feel compelled to look up a few names and when I did so I had a better idea of the narrative.  There is a sense of Lewis Carroll and as a reader you enter the rabbit hole (a point the author made)  of the chaos that attended the first 100 days and beyond in the Trump version of the Executive Office.  I think the author focused so much on Jared and Ivanka since they decided to be so, let's say, busy at doing government as like a job.  I really had no idea about Jared and Ivanka and was quite amazed at their behavior. I thought the book would have more information about Bannon but since he is such a reticent figure I imagine he will write something, someday about his experiences, I think this book opened that door very wide for that event. This book also does describe some alarming behavior and warning signs of various possible disorders in Donald Trump's schema.  I personally would leave that diagnosis to a competent psychiatrist.  Like anyone else I'm thankful to put down the book and imagine the rest of the world:  Shift my focus to happier and more healthy topics.  If you are curious about the Trump administration's first year in office, this is a fun book to read.",January-16-2018,4
2687,"I found the story fascinating.  It is a vivid depiction of a campaign and administration plagued by ineptitude, disorganization and infighting at the highest levels, told from the perspective of a ""fly on the wall"" journalist. To anyone who's been paying close attention for the past two years, the revelations herein are not very surprising, but the purported details are very interesting. Wolff's description and analysis of the personal and political dynamics shaping the White House seem informed and on target.That having been said, I have to take issue with way the author has sourced and reported many of those details. Most glaringly, he offers as unqualified direct quotes statements that he was not and could not have been witness to. Nowhere in the book does he differentiate between things that were said directly to him and conversations he heard about through second- or third-hand hearsay. He does not identify his sources for hearsay, and while he has coyly suggested the existence of recordings in his media interviews, he has yet to my knowledge to state categorically that he recorded any or all of his conversations.On his TV tour, he has acknowledged that he frequently had to distill the truth from multiple and often contradictory sources. This fact should have been disclosed prominently in a preface to the book. His methods for obtaining quotes should have been similarly disclosed in a preface and hearsay clearly identified in the text.As for the text itself, I found the author's style a bit dense and self indulgent. He tends to use compound sentences excessively. He throws in obscure words and references that often cloud his meaning and are occasionally even misused. I was grateful for the dictionary and Wikipedia functions of my reader.Despite its flaws, Fire and Fury is a good and informative read. If made into a movie it will be more docudrama than documentary, but it offers a useful and, I think, ultimately honest perspective on the Trump White House.",January-30-2018,3
2688,"Very interesting inside information. Only criticism is book feels like it was written in a rush, but overall would purchase again.",March-7-2018,4
2689,"Much of this book has been excerpted in news articles, while the remaining episodes are still fresh, often less than a year old. So often the book provides more context than is needed. Honestly, there is less here that surprises me. By now, it has become clear the The Emporer Has No Clothes is a good metaphor for all things Trump; and author Wolff uses it frequently. The only part that I didnâ€™t realize so completely was that Trump, Bannon, Jared and Ivanka are all expert leakers to the press. The entire time the White House has complained about leaking it has been their own work. They do it for different reasons but they do it constantly. If I had a greater familiarity with the NY media world circa 1980s, I may have understood that earlier. RE: whether or not the book has every detail locked down as truth, there are so many details painting the larger picture that readers get the idea. It is a broad-brush picture of Trump World that I accept as accurate. It fits most other reporting and commentary provided over the past 18 months. Itâ€™s depressing.",January-6-2018,4

Though we have heard and/or observed this perplexing behavior for ourselves, it is interesting to me to have some of the background, some of the other players exposed enough to see how things are interrelated.  I wasn't familiar enough with the traditionally accepted MO's of certain venues to understand the magnitude of the egregiousness. Least favorite has to do with delivery. I listened on Audible. The reader is very professional but disappointingly unengaged with the magnitude of  disclosures/observations/content. My taste as a listener begged for more expressive delivery of the content being revealed.  It wasn't bad. Just not matched well with my personal preferences for dramatic delivery..",January-11-2018,5

2725,"Fire and Fury depicts the nightmare of every employee who works for a capricious tyrant: among the thinning ranks of those willing to serve, there is no one to trust, the need to pick a champion among bad choices and the feeling that one is running away through quicksand with no hope of a safe escape. Michael Wolff has deftly crafted a blow-by-blow description of the barely-elected leader of the free world as a demented Capt. Queeg on the bridge of the USS America, ignoring his navigators and first officers and terrorizing his captive passengers as he heads the ship of state between Scylla and Charybdis, undecided about which form of destruction would prefer to take down the ship.The authorâ€™s previous experience in the popular press and Hollywood gossip suits him well to tell-all account of the inaugural year in the term of a playboy developer and entertainer turned accidental politician, as told to him by a clever, calculating pretender to the throne the president thinks he occupies. Wolff should be admired for employing his command of a large vocabulary, incisive analysis and nuanced, fast moving, prose, as impressive in his expressive power as his primary subject is deficient. My only reservation is that the picture the author presents may indeed be that of a calculating, unreliable narrator in Steve Bannon. This pretender to the throne Trump thinks he occupies, and others like him,  present an even greater, continuing threat to our future political stability.Nonetheless, Wolff has done our country a valuable service by unmasking this humbug and the chaos he has generated at the heart of our government. In so doing, he alerts us to the fact that Trumpism, with or without its namesake. is a clear and present danger to our democracy and our very way of life.â€”Peter  H.

Besides describing the shocking details of the daily chaos in the White House, Wolff does a good job recapping all of the events of the past 18 months in a way that the average citizen can understand. I have heard Trump supporters say some of the details of the book aren't true, but if 1% of it is accurate,  (I'm sure it's much more) that would still be too much. The saddest part is that within one week after the release of the book Trump has already said and  done so much more that this is already old news. I hope there is a sequel.

Some of the information about the bumbling and backbiting of the President and his staff members would be funny if it weren't so alarming, and if it weren't the President of the United States and the people surrounding him behaving in such a manner.

Generally Trump loyalists will condemn this book and non Trump loyalists will believe everything that is written.  I believe the truth is somewhere in between, but my feeling us there is more correct information than incorrect information.  This book is explosive and it paints Trump as a whinning baby who must be dealt with 'kid gloves '. I feel this is inaccurate , yet it is believable.  This book won't change people's view of Trump but will describe the utter chaos which exists inside the Trump Presidency and will continue to exist throughout his term.",January-29-2018,4
2802,The book is written in such a way it places you in the middle of all of the chaos. I have no idea how much of this is accurate: however it does match the narrative of Donald Trump. I donâ€™t like him. I was a â€œanyone except trumpâ€ù Republican. The book was good.,January-7-2018,5
2803,Interesting book to get a glimpse of what is happening in WhiteHouse,January-16-2018,5
2804,It is great gossip but perhaps not great literature.,January-18-2018,4
2805,"I was really disappointed in this book. there's so much repetition .  didn't feel like he was giving me much new after the first 100 pages. I expected exciting and interesting, got boring.",March-31-2018,2
2806,Excellent. Informative. Well written.,March-13-2018,5
2807,Interesting and insightful tidbits that broaden our understanding of the various characters who are playing government in the White House.,March-13-2018,3
2808,A very quick read if you pay attention to the news.  The salacious back office gossip makes for a fun read,March-13-2018,4
2809,"Didnâ€™t want to read one more word about the chaos we are all so very well aware of. But......nobody, not even the President, should ever tell people in America what they can or cannot read. I think he forgets we are Americans not Russians.",January-5-2018,5
2810,All references to me are accurate.,February-15-2018,5
2811,Purchased the book solely  since the current resident of the White House wanted to stop it from being published. Much of it  reads like what we see and hear in the news. Wolff is a so so writer.,February-21-2018,3
2812,Michael Wolf was clearly looking at just the most negative things he could find - not positive items at all even though Trump has done some good things for the economy and working people .,March-8-2018,4
2813,Good,January-11-2018,5

2821,"What a great book about a terrible topic - Trump actually makes me miss Nixon a little bit. But if you want a closeup of just how bad things are in the West Wing, this book will give it to you.",January-10-2018,5
2822,"Very good read, however, I do think that there are places where he plays with the truth. Go in with an open mind and if you wonder about something written in there, you can always research it. I would suggest this book to those who tend toward the left side of politics.",February-2-2018,4
2823,"Interesting read, scary to o.",March-4-2018,4
2824,Very interesting book.,March-25-2018,5
2825,"This book has been rapidly portrayed as irresponsible and full of lies by people who appear to feel their interests are in jeopardy. I think that this is a well written and documented book, and it is a good frame that I believe has helped me to find explanations to the explosion of inexplicable things that keep occurring during Trump's stint as president of United States. This book triggers an interest in paying more attention to the structures that appear to run behind any government.",January-12-2018,5
2826,Most interesting story about the inner workings of the White House.,March-13-2018,5
2827,"Seems balanced, good review by writer I respect.Unfortunately the people who should read the book wonâ€™t or canâ€™t",February-28-2018,3
2828,Great look at a truly dysfunctional group of ugly Americans.,February-12-2018,4
2829,"I listened to the audio version of this book and I found it to be quite entertaining. Their were portions of the book that were funny, thought provoking and informative and serval portions that a seemed to be gibberish. The narrative was crisp and spontaneous, I was worried that the narrative might dull and monotone...but it was not...interesting information...worth the time.",January-10-2018,4
2830,"It is sometime terrific, funny and sad to see how dysfunctional this white house is. How cynical our congress and politicians have become to enable this masquerade designed to con our simple minded idealists, to seduce our cynical opportunists and trap our most illiterates and frustrated people. I mean, today Trump and co (including Paul Ryan and dear Mitch) were at Camp David all standing together for the historic pictures. Overall, a group of men that still believe that Adam and Eve were riding dinosaurs in a world created 6000 years ago.Trump response to this book is to tweet a few hours is that he is ""like very smart"" and a ""genius"", while sending some of his cronies on cable TV try to have us all believe he ""revolutionized TV"" and didn't actually bought his way in with money. If only my father had also given me a million dollar to start my life in New York back then!Yet, while reading this book I was fascinated by the dynamic of powers at play against the status quo that Bush and Clinton had trapped us into since Reagan. It almost feels as Trump is some sort of new Reagan, and by that I mean a showman turned into a useful tool by greedy and soulless corporations and re-branded as some sort of anti-conventional conservative hero for the common man, and yet, this one feels rebooted for a short-span, dumbed down generation. Still, it is interesting to see how power preserves itself through the trinity of greed, opportunism, and bad faith, fueled by ignorance and manipulation.I don't doubt that Wolff may have edited, merged, combined or combined some elements while drafting this, very likely for the sake of clarity, but frankly it feels consistent with what we've all seen coming from this white house. There is where we can see Bannon's state of mind and agenda as a failed, frustrated intellectual who couldn't get past his own hatred of the system, still guided by a self destructive taste for the apocalypse. Almost a romantic kind, lost in true darkness. Trump's family comes out as one sadly entitled, spoiled, and monstrous entity engineered by our dysfunctional society. Truly, the worst of what capitalism and human nature has to offer. There is some beauty to it as well with our 45th president, a simple ignorant childman who just wanted to be loved and who will ironically end up hated by most and ridiculed throughout history. And all together, it is sad to see their desire to reform normality for the better corrupted by their own inability to understand the world they live in.In form, reality may be a bit different than what this book display, but in substance it feels like a genuine tableau of a disaster at play. It feels detailed enough to give you more than a sense of this giant and dramatic farce of a white house.Overall, my take is that there is an ideology crisis in America and possibly the post-cold war world, and these people; Fox news, the tea party's key authorities and Trump and his lavish cast of billionaires are all surfing over people's social insecurities, fears, ignorance, and basic instincts not to say stupidity, and this to extend their own power instead of pushing an honest and constructive democratic debate for the greater good of society.One way or another, these people will be judged by history, and so will their enablers. And still, we all are more or less, accomplice of this farcical monstrosity, until we wake up. Maybe something good will come out of it.",January-7-2018,4

2837,Enjoyed the insight into what is supposed to be a â€œworkingâ€ù White House. Scary stuff......the US has elected a very volatile president,January-15-2018,5
2838,Interesting,March-21-2018,5
2839,The author paints a very detailed narrative that gives evidence to what a lot of us already suspected was happening in the White House.,January-18-2018,4
2840,"The book flows very easily and is very well put together. A touch of humor and irony by the author makes for a better digestion of such horrible content. Very sad, incomprehensible, unfair; that the most important seat in the world is currently occupied by a megalomaniac, ignorant, incompetent clown. Sad and unfair that the position once occupied by men of the stature of Abraham Lincoln, T. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Woodrow Wilson, Eisenhower; JFK; and more recently Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama has now been handed to an ape with the attention span of a toddler; who is surrounded by family and friends with no valid credentials to hold public office. Incomprehensible that this man's voter base still defend him.Trump is not a republican; he is not a democrat nor independent. He only follows the ideology he thinks is momentarily good for business and can help him reach his goal. He decided to side with the republican party because, as he had previously mentioned, republicans believe whatever you tell them. And republicans are amongst the groups of people that better respond to demagogic discourse. He basically told them what they wanted to hear and promised many unrealistic feats  with no real argument on how he was going to achieve them. All of that crap about America first, the wall, muslim ban etc., are part of Bannon's agenda.The contents of this book should be taught in schools so future generations learn and avoid our mistakes; and maybe help us recover our dignity as society.",January-9-2018,5

2844,Wow _Ÿ˜_ what a book and Amazon delivered it  quickly. TY,March-10-2018,3
2845,The information is important however his delivery is rather contrived. I envision him sitting at his computer with a thesaurus trying too hard !I find his story telling annoying and if had known of his writing style I would have consumed my information another way.Buyer Beware.,February-17-2018,3
2846,Very interesting information,February-9-2018,5
2847,This book is amazing fun.,February-28-2018,5
2848,Why LOL you say?  Because you can count me in as one of many who saw this presidential scenario for what it could be long before the pitiful excuse of an electoral college elected this sorry piece of humanity.  I laugh to ward off despair as I see this country becoming mired in the muck this man and his enablers have allowed us to sink.  Wolfe has given us a valuable insight into just how low a man who only cares for his own personal gain will take  this nation.,January-25-2018,5
2849,I was sure lucky to get this before they ran out of it.  My neighbors loved it too,February-8-2018,5

2862,A completely true look at this joke of an administration!,March-12-2018,5
2863,"Excellent. This is well written and constantly fascinating.  Sometimes Mr. Wolff simply allows DJT to speak for himself.  For those who have only heard snippets of his infamous speech at the CIA, for example, Wolff includes a lengthy portion of it--rambling, self-praising, incoherent.  The book is frequently funny--or would be, if the stakes were not so serious.",January-6-2018,5
2864,Thank you!,April-25-2018,5
2865,Very engrossing book.,March-10-2018,5
2866,I am not done reading this book but it is very interesting.  I purchased the kindle version and have the hard copy on order.  So far it rings true to me based on what was already learned from Twitter and the very real news.  The author shouldn't have been allowed in the White House if they didn't want him to write the book.  I would encourage everyone to read this book especially since we do not ban books in America!,January-6-2018,5
2867,Apart from a couple editing errors this book is very well written and is a damning expose of this trainwreck of an administration lead by this man-baby. The book corroborates everything that I already knew about this administration but gives a much worse and bleak outlook on how bad things are and how unhinged this president is. This will go down in the history books as one of the darkest chapters of our country along with slavery.,January-8-2018,5
2868,Excellent. Now I know he man is insane !,April-26-2018,5
2869,This incompetent group allowed Wolff to hang out in ththe West Wing for months. Itâ€™s on them that what he observed was chaos. We deserve to know whatâ€™s going on and this is worse than mainstream media has reported. Good luck everyone!,January-5-2018,5

2874,A great read. Fantastic book,February-23-2018,5

2887,I am not in politics and only watch news in the mornings. But I knew most of the stuff he wrote in this book.It was an easy reading but wasn't much insightful. You will learn maybe one or two interesting facts but definitely not worth the price.,April-29-2018,2

2906,"The contents of the book are hilarious until you realize omfg, this clown has more power than anyone in the world, then the unmitigated terror sets in. If only a fragment of it is factual, the horror remains: The United States of America is being lead by an unhinged toddler.If Trump hadn't made so much shrill noise over it's publication, I likely wouldn't have bothered with it. But it's compelling. Buy it.",January-6-2018,5
2907,this book tells the story of our Supreme Orange Leader. It gives you insight on the daily operations of the Trump White House and just how really bad this man is at running anything but his mouth.

And regardless of what the good doctor Admiral says of the presidents cognitive state, it is clear those who deal with him daily have him pegged.

Some of the political complexities of our time are â€œlostâ€ù on Wolff so he doesnâ€™t get five stars, but a book that could so successfully infuriate both sides of the political divide and lead the Democratic establishment to quote Bannon as a reputable source has to be given due credit for pulling off such an impressive feat.",January-25-2018,4

2956,Amazingly juicy and believable given Trumpâ€™s own antics.  It explains a lot if you get what I mean,January-6-2018,5
2957,Every American citizen should read this book!,February-21-2018,5
2958,"Nothing I didn't expect - a little over the top in places, but given the chaos in the WH and our moron president, I'm not questioning much of it.",March-19-2018,3
2959,Interesting book.,February-28-2018,5
2960,Fascinating subject but the writer uses vocabulary that is not everyday so makes it more difficult to read and comes off as condescending to the reader.,March-13-2018,3
2961,Read this in two days,February-13-2018,5
2962,"This didn't have much beyond what had already been reported in the news. This only goes a bit deeper into those new stories. Given that footage of much of the stories in here have been broadcast for the world to see, the reference to whether this information is 'true' will always be up for debate.Throughout the book, I had to ask myself what seemed believable. There isn't much that will be validated until the current administration is history. Until then, this book may offer possible explanations to the points that don't add up from the news stories. I found most of the information to be plausible.The biggest strike against this book was the language. Some of it can't be avoided if they are actual quotes. However, it seemed Wolff had to embellish OR the 'really smart people' really do have potty mouths. Considering some of the pre-election video clips of these people, it's not a stretch to think they talk that way.Given the behavior of the players in this book haven't really denied the information, it lends some credibility. Due to the fact also that Trump won't actually take legal action against the whistle-blowers (which would require actual legal discovery) that also lends some credibility as well. The punishment directed at Bannon also suggests the info in this hit close to home.In the end, as with all information, it's up to the consumer of that information to determine what floats. I would recommend reading up on logical fallacies to help weed through the news and silliness. Regardless of what's being said out there, critical thinking does help one filter out the bad data.",January-11-2018,4
2963,"I totally expected this book to be about an arrogant moron who is so totally self absorbed, and destructive on such a large scale, as to not realize how much of a destructive moron he is.Sad to say, I guess I was correct in my assumption.",March-27-2018,4
2964,I lost interest after a while. Lots of spelling and grammatical errors. Some comments by the author seemed too dramatic to be true. Maybe they are. Maybe they aren't. But the lack of substance sort of caused me to question is credibility. I then wondered if I really wanted to spend the next few hours finishing the book. I put it down.,March-7-2018,2
2965,"This was an entertaining read to be sure, but it seems very dubious that the author could prove that many of these conversations or encounters ever occurred.",February-22-2018,3
2966,Thoroughly riveting read. This â€˜tell allâ€™ story mixing fact with fiction captures the feelings Iâ€™ve long held about this Administration (has it only been a year?). Iâ€™ve based my feelings on each startling revelation in the news about this ongoing chaotic reality show. Mr. Wolff validated those feelings.,January-17-2018,5
2967,It's a good read.,March-26-2018,5
2968,Excellent Book,January-18-2018,5

2974,Everyone needs to read or listen to this book,January-10-2018,5
2975,"Reading this book is like watching a train wreck. You can't look away. Fairly horrifying overall but pretty well-told, even given the sensationalist, gossipy tone. Recommended, especially if you're as horrified by this so-called president as I am.",March-7-2018,3
2976,Excellent read...a real page turner!!!,March-11-2018,5
2977,Tells the story in another form in a way that you canâ€™t possibly recruit by following the news or reading.,January-20-2018,4

2979,fascinating.,March-13-2018,5

2981,Kaos at its best,March-12-2018,5
2982,"Oh, the horror. The horror. Wolffâ€™s been called an unreliable narrator, but I think he gets much right. The out-sized personalities. The paranoia. The chaos. The chickens-without-a-head atmosphere. If it wasnâ€™t so serious it would be comical.",April-1-2018,3
2983,"A real page turner. Couldn't put it down. Truth is stranger than fiction. Non-fiction that read like fanciful fiction. Great book, Michael Wolff deserves a Pulitzer.",March-7-2018,5
2984,"Itâ€™s not the kind of book thatâ€™s going to change anyoneâ€™s mind or opinion.  Itâ€™s a bit too gossipy and shallow to be taken too seriously.  A bit like the President himself, I guess.",March-30-2018,3
2985,"Illuminating. If it's true or even mostly true, I'm scared.",March-13-2018,4

2995,loved the book,February-22-2018,5
2996,Enjoyed the book not feeling is if you understand half of what is written we are in deep trouble.,March-8-2018,5
2997,I think I liked this book so much because it reads like a sitcom of dramatic characters. The Trump administration is so full of petty idiots that they were constantly at each otherâ€™s throats. Iâ€™m not usually into non-fiction but I couldnâ€™t put this one down!,January-22-2018,5
2998,"This a must read/listen.  It does not disappoint.  The book confirms all of the news reports regarding the Trump White House, from an inside independent perspective.  I am listening via audiobook and it is amazing.",January-5-2018,5
2999,yep. well worth it.,February-7-2018,5
3000,"I normally do not buy ebooks until they become 1 or 2 dollars on bookbub  I don't regret buying this ebook for $15 , and I would buy it again.  It is hard to believe that Trump is still in the white house.  I am looking forward to see how this presidency ends and just how much mischief this president has been up to.  He is in over his head, for sure.  What a mess.  I worry about the doj  and our free press and hope that our country can repair the damage done by this mistake  of a presidency.",January-28-2018,4
3001,Great read.,March-3-2018,5
3002,"An interesting statement, but no real meat. The key take away is; how on earth did the author get to sit on a sofa in The White House long enough to write this book. The book seems to have been overtaken by recent events, which are even more dramatic than the book.",February-19-2018,3
3003,Interesting,March-3-2018,4
3004,Great Book!! Great Seller!!,February-7-2018,5
3005,A fast read that fills in some of the blanks of today's news on the subject. Worth the read if you are not a Fox viewer - since you will have an open mind and things will make sense for you.,March-6-2018,5

3010,"Just started to read, so far very interesting",February-8-2018,5
3011,"'Fire and Fury' is a fun read.  I enjoyed reading Wolff's prose and he really pulls you into WH intrigue, some of which has already been exposed, blended in with new observations. Well worth buying!",January-10-2018,5
3012,"It was okay. Not as juicy as I thought it would be.Read about 3/4 of it hoping if would get better. I will finish it, but don't know when.",April-15-2018,3
3013,"In my opinion as an average voter and US citizen, this book is an overall accurate retelling of Trump's  first 9 months as President.The events, controversies, rumors and news reporting of the chaos at the time of the events are organized into a narrative that injects the visceral reactions of Trump's inner circle.I know Trump supporters who stopped listening to the news after Trump's election. Any negative item about him they did manage to hear was dismissed as ""fake news"" and a ""what about Hilary?"" This book can get them up to speed with the reality of the mess called the Trump Presidency.If you were one the millions of people who closely followed the real news reporting this past year, you may find the book a bit anticlimactic. We know all this. We know Donald Trump and almost his entire staff have no real expertise and qualifications for their position.The value of this book is putting the experience of the Trump/Bannon chaos into the historical record.",January-11-2018,4

3017,Great book.,February-28-2018,5
3018,This book gives  a very convincing and detailed look at the dysfunction that is ruling the country now. I think everything Michael Wolff has written is true. America and the world has good reason to be very nervous for the future with such a madman at the helm.,February-27-2018,5

3034,Nothing new or fascinating here. I would read this book right before bedtime and fall asleep within minutes. I wish Michael would have written this better. It's just a long boring book.,April-2-2018,2
3035,Great read!,February-25-2018,5
3036,"Had I confidence in knowing that President Trump had the wherewithal and skill to read anything longer than a fast food restaurant menu, I might easily accept his labeling this book as fake. The stories in this book are at once outlandish, disturbing and intriguing. So much so that I found myself having to take it in very small doses throughout.The authorâ€™s claimed frame of reference is the halls and waiting areas just outside Trumpâ€™s reach. Though the book is ultimately about Trump, his reach in the book never quite touches Trump and instead is completely filtered through the revolving cast of characters working with and around Trump. This point of view makes the book even more surreal as he paints those people as being as much flawed and overwhelmed as Trump himself. This altogether gives the book the sense of taking place in an old insane asylum.Within that sense is a back story about many of the events of the Trump presidency that has left me dumbfounded. The White House seems to be crazy from the outside. This story reinforces that with an even bigger story of crazy from the inside. Itâ€™s too much to explain. You have to read it to know.",March-4-2018,4
3037,Awesome!,March-8-2018,5
3038,Crazy. Scary. Fascinating. Hard to put it down.,January-29-2018,5
3039,Nothing new here. Trump world is totally dysfunctional as evidenced by his childish tweets and nonpresidential behavior. The hype was just to sell more books.,February-28-2018,3

3042,enjoyed reading,March-7-2018,5
3043,The book was somewhat repetitive...most likely because the events were repetitive. I wonder how many staffers will write books after-the-fact,April-1-2018,4
3044,Revealing of the chaos that I suspect ed existed in the WH.Very scary if even half of it is true.,February-4-2018,4
3045,food for thought.,February-19-2018,5
3046,"After reading this most disturbing book, we should pray that we elect a President who will strive to â€œmake America Sane again!â€ù  It seems that the current administration should use this slogan: by the Trumps, for the Trumps.",March-13-2018,4
3047,"This book was very well written and fascinating. It was a quick read. Yes, there were some editing errors in the Kindle version. Also, the author did add a lot of comments set off by dashes; but once I adjusted to his writing style, this was not a problem. I found this made the book more entertaining.Some of what was stated in the book had been in the news. So, there were not a lot of surprises. Trump's own actions and comments support the book's veracity. I found myself oftentimes feeling sorry for Donald Trump, and other times just shaking my head. Before I read the book, I believed Jared and Ivanka were the voice(s) of reason in the White House. Now I believe the book proves that you should never hire your inexperienced family members as presidential advisors.Highly recommend.",January-28-2018,5
3048,Great read.,February-22-2018,5
3049,Amazing book.  Its really a must read by everyone. It will give you new perspective on the Trump administraiton. Just amazing. Read it and make your own judgements.;,January-15-2018,5
3050,An eye opening read and an insight into the workings of the Trump White House. Nothing really surprised me with the exception of the power Steve Bannon had over Trump. I found the whole book very frightening to be honest and I wonder just where our country will go from here.,January-20-2018,4
3051,Validation about the chaos our White House lives with daily,January-10-2018,5
3052,"This is the mass-market hit job on President Donald Trump that he deserves.  The book reads like a trashy novel and is filled with what amounts to tabloid gossip.  Grab a barf bag, as this book, like this presidency, will make you sick to be an American.  Wolff shows Trump for the terrible human being that we know he is and you will feel the glee of seeing the school bully get his butt kicked in the school yard.  Trump likes to roll in the mud and now he is covered in it.  Good.  But, for you politically savvy readers, it needs to be said, Michael Wolff is no Bob Woodward.",January-8-2018,4
3053,A fun read that validated my concerns. Not much new . Info. Most tidbits have been in the news. However it was eye opening to know the caliber of misfits running the place.,March-7-2018,3

3063,"Wolff's style is highly readable.  Much in the book has previouly been discussed in ThePost, NYYimes, and New Yorker, along withother publications and cable news.  Synthesizingis excellent.  Long and bizarre tale of a president's first year.",January-10-2018,5
3064,"What a fascinating account of the first 10 months of the Trump Administration. This book provides the missing piece of the reporting; naming the leakers.  The one factor under-explored was why there were so many competing interests in the first place. A true leader, not merely a personality, would have melded all factions together.  So sad.",January-7-2018,4

3067,"I'm only 2 chapters in (day of release) but it is very interesting, well-written, and a speedy read. If you were able to keep up with all the trump publicity, you wont hear anything new.I look at this book as a historical document, something I will reflect on years after Trump is gone. I am hopeful for the ""post-Trump"" era and naively believe this book/record will help mark the line between when men like this ruled and the better world.",January-5-2018,5

3082,"Great read!  Nothing surprising as it only reveals what we already knew, that tRump is narcissistic, moronic, corrupt, and amoral individual. The book provides a lot clues on how all the different clowns that have circulated through the White House fit in the big picture.  Some of it is speculation on Wolff's behalf, in terms of people's motivations and how they were thinking, but it is mostly there to connect the dots.  Highly recommended.",February-5-2018,5

3110,I started reading it this morning. Finally someone tells it like it is about The Donald. Trump's trying to stop publication only help spread it far and wide. I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time. I strongly recommend it to anyone who wishes this past year had never happened and wish Trump had stayed a reality show host you could turn off.,January-5-2018,5

3114,I enjoyed the insight that this book gives...especially showing how the Trump family can and will be taken down by Mueller. I now look at Trump as a scared little rabbit. And look at Ivanka and Jared as greedy little players who will ultimately be the two responsible for the downfall of Donald Trump.,January-14-2018,5

3120,loved the book  very informative,January-24-2018,5
3121,I enjoyed the book it is possible that everything is not correct or complete but in general I felt like it gave me a inside look at what was happening  and about Trump's thinking.,March-7-2018,5
3122,"May be more fiction than not, but it is certainly entertaining.  Admittedly I think of the potus this way sometimes, but if I take this book as true nonfiction I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.",January-11-2018,3

3135,Very interesting,March-5-2018,4
3136,"Based on interviews of Michael Wolff on various news and entertainment outlets and the author's own statement that he had to stretch the truth in some instances just to let people realize the chaos in the White House was out of control.  I guess it's called being glib.  Anyway, most of what he writes about has been since verified but in the end the reader is left with more questions rather than answers about Trump's agenda.  Maybe that's because it's always been an agenda in progress subject to the daily whim of Trump himself.  It does prove one thing though and that is that Trump is definitely in over his head.  Whether or not Trump really wants or wanted to be President is also not answered.  He failed to address what everyone else is asking:  did Trump run for financial gain?  That is, there's lots to be gained by being a perpetual candidate in terms of usable money from campaign fund raising, a full war chest and the pitfalls for someone like Trump to fall into because of his dearth of ethics.  I need to re-read this book.  Maybe I missed something that was supposed to read between the lines.",March-7-2018,2

3141,"Don't read this book unless you have a strong stomach for what is going on in the White House.  The book is loaded with facts that will leave you with the uneasy feeling that our leader is an ignorant malignant narcissistic sociopath, surrounded by incompetent, scrapping advisors.  I honestly still can't believe that nearly half of those who voted put him in a position of power where he can even start a nuclear war on his own.",January-30-2018,5
3142,"This is an amazing book. Have watched Wolff's comments in interviews, read reviews, and find the current situation appalling and fascinating. Wolff has clearly explained Trump's win, and filled in background for readers. Helps make some sense of this last year. Events and outlooks in this book seem clearly accurate if you have been following politics. It didn't cheer me up, but it certainly helped me better understand current events. It also enforced my belief in our amazing Constitution. Perhaps, unless it is obvious, I should add that I am a Democrat. I do think that a lack of understanding of the Constitution's separation of powers, and an inability or unwillingness to honestly face this country's needs are  FAR more important, or should be, than party affiliation. As we watch  totally unqualified people given department head positions, and the blurring of lines when it comes to separations of powers, Wolff has helped fuel the fires of protesters. Although it's frightening that it needs to be said, loudly and often ""COUNTRY OVER PARTY,"" Wolff's book was perfectly timed. And it's totally believable, sadly.",February-1-2018,5
3143,"I purchased this book because Donald Trump wanted to stop its publication. In the United States nobody can demand that book publication be stopped. I wanted a better understanding of the person making the demand. I am appalled by what I learned.

3145,I can't put my original review up because it was apparently too sarcastic and hilarious for Amazon. Read this book. Buy a few extra copies to support your rights as an American to read whatever you like. Be prepared though. I read a lot of Stephen King and Trump is much more terrifying than Pennywise or Leland Gaunt or Kurt Barlow. But you need to know how out of control this presidency is. We cant let this happen again. Ever.,January-15-2018,5

3147,"A bit over hyped.  Nothing too much new in the book.  Rife with grammatical errors.  Seemed slapped together.  Also, Wolff has a habit of including asides in the middle of sentences repeatedly which make it annoying to read.  Often these asides have nothing much to do with the broader sentence structure.",March-7-2018,3

Local religious extremists were picketing the theater.)I cannot say that reading the book was enjoyable.  It reflects the troubling times we are in now and the likelihood of difficult times ahead.  And I am asked to trust this author regarding the details.  It would be easier for me if Wolff had been a journalist with the discipline imposed by a news editor.  As it is, the quotes and attributions stand as gossip (though I am inclined to believe most or all of them, since they appear to fit logically with information already public).The broad brush (e.g., ""All of the senior staff..."") may be true, but could a careful investigator not find a true believer among them?  I am certain that I could not work in this administration, but there must be one who is as devoted to Trump as I have been to other elected officials for whom I have worked.Did I learn anything?  Some details, perhaps, but not the big picture.  I had known that this president is a dangerously ignorant narcissist from his public statements.  Is his public persona (a childish, insecure man who holds grudges, lashes out at real or perceived opposition, and evidences no maturity) likely to be similar to his behavior in the White House?

3234,"So, have finished my first listen-through of Fire and Fury via Audible (the narrator is excellent).  Basically, the book is a Cliffs Notes version of American MSM over the past year.  Nothing too surprising, although interesting tidbits here and there, such as The Mooch was considered for what has to be the best gig in the galaxy: U.S. Ambassador to the OECD, which comes with a 20-room ""apartment"" in Paris, full staff, and absolutely no responsibilities.  Trump, it is clear, is just a vehicle, a tool, for others to obtain the power or push their policies through.  He is utterly oblivious to this fact.  And it extends even to his own children, who don't refer to him as dad, but DJT.  The only seeming humanity that comes through for this man-child, is that he allegedly does ""love"" Melania, although he literally refers to her as his trophy wife without any sense of irony or realization that it is not a compliment either to him or Melania.At bottom, the White House doth protest too much over this book.  It is not so much a critique of the utterly bizarre and disorganized mess the executive branch has become (and to be sure, it is that in large doses), but an examination of Trump--a lonely, petulant man-child wholly unaware of his power, his place in history, and his responsibility (indeed, it seems that that concept-responsibility-is a concept unknown to him).Fire and Fury is, in essence, the Truman Show with Trump as Truman.  In that regard, it is very hard to believe that someone could be so shallow, so anti-intellectual (the fact he refuses to read absolutely anything is beaten to death in the book), so lacking in self-awareness and yet exist, let alone function.  And yet, here he is.  The most powerful, yet loneliest man in the world, wholly incapable of reflection, let alone self-reflection.  It is, to use the cliche, a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions.The only upside to the book is that it reinforces the strength of our institutions.  That they are stronger than any single person, or even any single ""administration,"" which absolutely must be written with scare quotes when discussing the current ""administration.""  Trump didn't surround himself with incompetents and Wormtongues as much as they were foisted upon him or wriggled into his inner circle like a malignant cancer.  And as some cancers die (e.g., Bannon, Mooch) more appear.  Yet, the immune systems of our institutions are quite strong.And so finally, what is quite apparent, is that Trump is so unsophisticated, so naive, that he could not have possibly colluded with the Russians, at least intentionally.  Indeed, if even a quarter of the book is to be believed, he never wanted the job.  And as I noted above, that is perfectly consistent with who Trump is, which unfortunately has been reinforced now that the presidency has been effectively forced on him.  Incompetence and an apparent urge for Junior to impress ""DJT"" was the source of the apparent collusion.  What is most unfortunate for Trump, is that he is quite literally too stupid to effectively respond to the investigation and, mainly as a result of all the Machiavellis surrounding him, only makes matter worse.  In short, no one learned from Nixon (and yes, I can hear Trump ask: ""Who's Nixon?  What's Watergate?"") that it is the cover-up that gets you.So, at the end, a breathtaking read, but not because there are any explosive revelations (although many tabloid-ish gossipy items), but rather the full picture it paints of Trump.  Friends, we clearly are without a leader.  There is no president in office.  The Emperor not only has no clothes, but no mind or even a tentative grasp on reality other than satisfying his own immediate needs for food and entertainment.  And while that may initially be frightening or even repulsive, in a sense it is (at least to me) reassuring.  Our great state, these United States, have behind them an inertia that a collective psychoses--really, I think, a collective prank we played on ourselves--cannot succumb to even the most inept people that we may place in the White House.  In other words, so far, we have past the test of Fire and Fury of this ""administration.""  And that is perhaps the best take-away from this book.  We are still here to read it.",January-5-2018,4

Reading about their BS in a longer format like this makes it a bit less rage-inducing, but If possible the truth is even stupider than we could ever have imagined. Anyway this book is full of really interesting tidbits that we didnâ€™t know prior to its release.

3244,Great book! Couldnâ€™t put it down. The author clearly outlines the dysfunction which is the Trump administration.  It makes one sad.,February-11-2018,5
3245,Good book,February-27-2018,5
3246,"I liked this book very much. It was a tad slow developing and it tends to ramble, however the content was excellent and believable. My contempt for trump and his family cartel is higher then ever. I wish every American would read it. The world would be a better place.",March-8-2018,5
3247,Very true information about this president,January-27-2018,5
3248,Nothing in this book is surprising or even shocking based on daily events unfolding in public. That being said it is a well written catalogue of the chaos that is this train wreck of an administration. This narrative stitches it all together in a concise and clear fashion.,February-23-2018,5
3249,I loved this book!,March-4-2018,5
3250,"Since I have been following this ongoing mess since it started, I was surprised by little.  I know that the small percentage of Trump supporters and the Trump News Channel will claim this to all be ""fake"".  What I find the most appalling is the continued and increasing support the Republicans are giving to this man.  Watching them extol his virtues and what a great president he is after the signing of the worst tax bill in history made me ill.  Our country and its reputation has been so damaged by this administration I can only hope that there will be no pardon for Trump and his family/staff.  I agreed after Watergate that the Nixon pardon was the right thing to do, to heal our country so we could move on.I also noticed a lot of grammar/spelling errors....maybe rushed to print to fast!!",January-5-2018,5
3251,If I've done my part to humiliate the idiot in office it was worth every penny. IMO..more factual than not.,January-29-2018,5

3255,The book is great ! I enjoyed reading it,January-30-2018,5
3256,Enjoying reading this!,January-18-2018,5
3257,Only reinforces most opinions already formed by pro & con Trump camps about both Trump & author.  Fun read. Not to be taken seriously.,April-6-2018,3
3258,Really hard to read. Not sure if it was the terrible person he had to write about or the long winded poor way that it was written.Guess he did the best he could with such a horrible man.,April-13-2018,2
3259,"Bought it for my Mom, she hates the Donald, enjoys the book. Helps her fall asleep at night. Always a good story.....",March-23-2018,5
3260,"I liked the content. It revealed to me the idea that Trump never thought heâ€™d win, hence his poor transition. What I really liked was that I looked up new words and phrases, something rare these days. I dare say any future historians will consider it requisite reading",March-16-2018,4
3261,I read the kindle version the weekend the book came out. Very believable and consistent with news reports.,March-17-2018,5
3262,I read this as a gossip source.  It was interesting and quite an easy read.  I found a few things that sent me on a quest to verify.,February-13-2018,4
3263,"Read the book and found it troubling at best.  The author's writing style and choice of chapter division was confusion. He created a hodge-podge of facts, personalities, and happenings and capitalized on the salacious nature of what he penned to sell books. I fear that some of what he wrote is true, which imbrues the very character of this nation and the principle of its politics.",March-12-2018,3
3264,You'll laugh you'll cry you'll laugh to keep from crying. It's funny because its sad that it's true.,March-8-2018,5

3266,Itâ€™s worse than we thought. He has to be impeached but the gop never will have the character that the gop of Nixonâ€™s day had,February-23-2018,5
3267,Great and informative,March-7-2018,5
3268,"This audiobook worked perfectly. The narrator does a great job with the material, able to do slight voices for different people and do their temperments. I will have to look up other things the author wrote, and things the narrator read.",March-3-2018,4
3269,Enjoyed the read. But I also enjoy People Magazine. It's a proper summation of much read about Trump in the main stream media. Not an important political treatise but an interesting one.,February-10-2018,3
3270,This is a gossip view of the White House and its inhabitants. I did not learn anything I did already knew or suspected but a fun read.,February-9-2018,3
3271,"""Fire and Fury"" effectively connects the dots of the news and events that has emerged from the drama of the White House during the first year of the Trump Administration.",January-14-2018,5
3272,WHOA. Quite a book. I learned a lot.,March-31-2018,5
3273,"the author used some words that are not in the dictionary;  also, he does not clearly describe situations and people of whom we are not very familiar.  Political insiders would enjoy this book more.",February-5-2018,3
3274,Omg are things screwed up in the Trump wh.,January-21-2018,5
3275,Itâ€™s a lot of ranting. I thought there should have been more discussions on economic impact and stuff like that. Sounded like a tabloid and doesnâ€™t even discuss his personal or family history.,March-30-2018,2
3276,You won't be able to put it down.  It verifies just about everything you ever thought about the tRump white house.,January-10-2018,5
3277,"Eye opening and surprising facts.....not fake news? A comprehensive book that explains much about the Trump administration and indeed,  Trump the man.",April-16-2018,4
3278,If you follow the news you tonight you pretty much know whatâ€™s in the book I didnâ€™t find it anymore informing them that,April-26-2018,3
3279,I totally enjoyed this book.  It really confirmed many things for me.,March-1-2018,5
3280,"If you followed the news, you knew most of if not all the details.The book did show how lost the president really is",February-23-2018,3
3281,I moved carefully towards this publication due to my own feelings of not wanting to be taken by the solicitous content. I found the subject matter very enlightening and would recommend this book for anyone who wanted a peek behind the curtain.,March-24-2018,4
3282,"I hesitated on the star rating, between 3 or5 stars. I have this vision of Wolf, sitting on a sofa somewhere in the middle of the White House, watching as scenarios unfold in front of him, with pen, notebook and recorder in hand. My only hesitation in rating the book higher is because of reports I've read from what I consider to be reliable sources, about previous instances of Wolf's lack of facts checking and a rather lax means of adherence to the truth. In this instance, reputation, either good or bad, does follow the author.On the other hand, I have read other accounts of Trump's bizarre behavior, by mental health professionals who, against rules of their association, have spoken out as concerned citizens about the frightening tendencies our president displays regularly. It truly is frightening!",January-23-2018,5
3283,It was entertaining.,March-13-2018,5
3284,"I listened to the Audible version because of a road trip, and couldnâ€™t wait. The book was well-written and easy to follow. The narration was also well done, even with voice changes for quotes in a way that distinguishes from the rest of the text. I was pleased with the selection and size of direct quotes, which can be easily fact-checked. Wolff is addressing what we all need to hear: the emperor is wearing no clothes. I also picked up from the audio a criticism of the press for their role in this rapidly approaching constitutional crisis. Some in the media have been fawning and feeding the immature presidential ego, and others have gone straight to hand-wringing horror. It is clear the media has helped to create this monster. The author is actually more balanced in his approach than you would expect from the title and pre-release publicity. Also, an illustration of the problem is the presidentâ€™s reaction to the release of this book. He thinks he is entitled to stop the publication. Hell, no! I will be purchasing the digital version to read again, and a hard copy (just because it is my right) to share.",January-6-2018,5
3285,Underscores what the well-informed media has been reporting from Day 1.  Trump is a disgrace to our nation and the world and everyone needs to be paying close attention.,January-10-2018,5
3286,A fascinating and frightening view into the inner circle of the white house. Really enjoyed this while also being terrifying.,March-7-2018,5
3287,Very entertaining and informative.,March-3-2018,5
3288,"Not going into much detail. A great read. Surprisingly (to me) well written. Am a news hound and still learned a lot. Probably some hype, literary license etc, but still informative and very very interesting.  â€˜Splains a lot.",January-6-2018,5
3289,Still amazed that this guy is the President of our United States. If this book is half true his next house will be a prison cell.,March-7-2018,5
3290,This book is a must read.  If I could give more then 5 stars I would!!!  The truth will set you free Dontard!!!,January-7-2018,5
3291,"Gotta have it! There are 2 details that were inaccurate from what I understand (names were mixed up) but that's not the author's fault--it's the publisher's editors and fact checkers. It will be corrected in the next pressing, since it's flying off the shelves. Hey, the version with the mistakes could be a collector's item some day! LOL.  Every credible political commentator I've heard says Wolfe nailed it.",January-26-2018,5
3292,"As an independent voter, I read Fire and Fury out of curiosity. It was a quick read. Some of the information in the books appears to be unfolding in real time on a daily basis. The book isn't so much about bashing the POTUS as it is about the staff who sway his opinion. Donald Trump and his campaign staff did not believe he would be elected president. They were all unprepared for the White House. This is the type book, one has to read for him/herself. I'm certain there are as many opinions of this book as there readers.",January-27-2018,5
3293,"A horrifying view inside the White House, but unlikely to be read by those who should and too much information for those who do.",February-22-2018,3
3294,"Was an enjoyable and easy read. Spent all day reading it, but enjoyed it. When you get past a few of the big quotes the media has reported, it is a book with multiple sources about a very dysfunctional organization in this White House led by a man who has no understanding of government or experience running any large organization. I have worked for a few dysfunctional corporations, including run by autocrats and dictators. This just takes it to a higher level of dysfunction but certainly not surprising to anyone who follows the news. I get it why people want to work in the White House, but it chews most up and adding total chaos is a recipe for personal and professional disaster. Given that most of the people in this book have zero experience working in government, and the extent of their hubris thinking that they can run the U.S. Government with no experience, you can see why the results have been so disastrous.",January-6-2018,5
3295,"I'm not surprised at all by anything stated in this book. Anyone with intelligence could see that this was how the administration would be from the chaos of trumps campaign. Ignorance, incompetence, and hubris, only this time ramped up to a level never seen before. Michael Wolf shines a truthful light on this administration and you know why it's a truthful light? Because Trump threatened to sue him and the publisher to keep the book from coming out.  When was the last time a sitting president did that? Excellent read!",January-20-2018,5
3296,A look at what is happening at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave....chaos!A must read.,January-5-2018,5
3297,If you are following all things TRUMP or if you don't know a things this is an excellent book that tells it like it is. Is it all true; we won't know until history has a chance to write about Trump. I think it's +90% true.,April-5-2018,5
3298,My dad happy with his book,February-9-2018,5

3300,You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear--what else is new?,January-8-2018,4
3301,"Finally received my copy.  Well written and, perversely, a fun read.  I truly hate that our country has distressed to this level.  I proudly supported President Obama and served our Country but now I am dumbfounded as to how we have distressed to our current situation.",January-13-2018,5
3302,"Too embellished to be completely believable. ""Based on a true story', maybe?",March-7-2018,3
3303,good and interesting reading,February-21-2018,4
3304,Well written and educational.,January-18-2018,5
3305,Gives the impression of a fly on the wall in the Trump White House.  Hard to believe he did not take great liberties with dialogue.  The timeline is only loosely coherent in places and it seems like he had a lot of stories that he added wherever he was low on pages for a particular chapter.  Glad I got this on credits from Audible - entertaining but not worth actual money.,January-11-2018,3
3306,"Interesting read, incredible what goes on in politics and when you have a loose cannon in office like this buffoon.",March-23-2018,5
3307,like reading a tabloid.  i have been following current events in detail the last several years and a lot of what he says is true.,February-13-2018,4
3308,Incredibly informative.,March-7-2018,5
3309,"While I wasn't surprised by any of the revelations about DT in the book, it's well worth the read just to have some context behind/around the stories we regularly see reported on in the news daily. DT needs to go!",January-6-2018,5
3310,"Tabloidish (yes, I made that word up)Wolff needs a writing class. It was painful to read because itâ€™s so poorly written.",March-15-2018,2
3311,"I have kept up with most everything in this book in the news for months. There were very few surprises but not much. Since the publication of this book, Mr. Bannon is out the door at Breitbart. I am disgusted with what is going on in the White House but the writing has always been on the wall. Many of the players have their own baggage as well as this president.Mr. Trump does not have the right to tell anybody they cannot buy this book. We still have a free press and the Constitution although I doubt that he has ever read it. I can't wait until the 2018 and 2020 elections and hopefully this gang in the White House will be replaced.",January-10-2018,5

3313,Good read,January-22-2018,5
3314,WOW! Read it if you dare and then follow up by reading the just released testimony by representative Fienstien that was released yesterday. Thank god for a free press!,January-11-2018,5
3315,I think it gives us another view of the chaos in the White House.,April-14-2018,4

3317,This book is awesome.  Thank you Michael Wolff.,February-12-2018,5
3318,"Received the book without a hitch. The book however is poorly written. I stopped reading 1/2 way through.Much of what's in it was already in the news. Although, the background leading to these concerns was interesting.",February-4-2018,4
3319,"This is an entertaining book. Not a lot of new revelations and I think people should definitely read it with a bit of skepticism, but there is no denying it is a fun read. This isn't a book that is going to change anyone's mind either way. There is enough doubt about some statements made to allow Trump supporters to call it #fakenews and enough already confirmed information and quotes from reliable sources (who have not denied they made those statements) to allow a non-supporter to reaffirm what they already knew. I enjoy the author's writing style and found the pacing of the book kept my interest.",January-7-2018,5
3320,"Not finished yet. But, it is a good read. The author keeps my interest. He doesn't ramble. I don't have to believe his version of everything, my eyes and ears have confirmed over the years that this is Trump. Won't 25th amend him, but don't think it was supposed to. And, best of all, it ticked Trump off to no end!",January-10-2018,4
3321,Very interesting and very readable.  Based on the repercussions it seems like this book hit some very sensitive nerves.,April-8-2018,5
3322,"This book is a little too gossipy.  At some point, you think you're reading the National Inquirer. If this were a book about the making of a movie and how the lead actor got along with the producer, director and co-stars, that would be one thing.  But  then you realize this is our GOVERNMENT and really start to get scared.  You find yourself wondering how our government is still functioning with all of the pettiness and infantile behavior among the various players.  Then you say, thank God for the ""Administrative State"" which is clearly keeping this ship of state afloat in the dysfunctional Trump era.  But I'm still a political junkie, so I confess I found it overall an interesting read.",March-6-2018,3
3323,I read it. Was entertaining. But the fact that it has Donny all hot & bothered was enough reason to pay real money for this book and give it 5-stars. Thank you M. Wolff for trolling the trolls.,January-8-2018,5
3324,"Great book. Almost comical if it wasn't a look inside the ""leader of the free world"" and his administration.",April-1-2018,5
3325,I hate Trump so I thought it was great!,March-7-2018,5
3326,"Entertaining read!  If one-tenth of the things are true, it just shows what a sleeze Trump truly is.",April-28-2018,4
3327,The book was a fake!  How does he have the quotes with out actually interviewing some of the contacts.  Do not waste your time.,March-7-2018,2
3328,"I downloaded this book because my perceptions of whatâ€™s happening in this administration has gone from annoying, to disturbing to very alarming .The author clearly explains the roles and politics within the Trump White House. I have a good understanding of the key players and their contributions. And his observations regarding our presidents state of mind seem consistent with what Americans are experiencing each day.Iâ€™ve always enjoyed reading Michael Wolff and this is no exception. In fact, I appreciate him tackling this issue of paramount importance to every American . This is my first read of 2018 and certainly memorable.",January-5-2018,5
3329,This book reveals and supports what we see every single day from the White House.  CHAOS IS OUR NEW REALITY.  The author answers my questions why the Trump family is dysfunctional having all lived in a superficial bubble.  There is no defence against ignorance.,January-16-2018,5
3330,"Easy to read, much of the book recounts the many publicized missteps of DJT. The news within the book is the degree of animus between the â€œBannonistsâ€ù and the â€œJarvankasâ€ù (Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump).",January-13-2018,5
3331,This explains a lot! I can't believe that Michael Wolff had so much access to the President. I'm sorry that he's not there now.,March-25-2018,5

3340,An amazing account of the first year of the Trump admin and the players involved.  It all makes sense now.,January-6-2018,5
3341,The book didnâ€™t tell us anything we didnâ€™t already know or were hardly surprised by. I read about half of it and quit.,March-17-2018,2

A rare diorama portraying the bickering, backstabbing dysfunctional family feud Whitehouse as it is, led by a moronic egomaniac,surrounded by a Gong Show of sycophantic unqualified and incompetent social climbers who are more concerned about media spin than running the country! Unbelievable. God help America.",January-12-2018,5

I know the POTUS doesn't like it and doesn't want it to exist. He feels so strongly about it in fact, he and his team of sleazy lawyers are trying to ban it, but I don't believe in banning books. I probably would not have been interested in this book at all apart from that fact. We don't ban books in the United States. We aren't Saudi Arabia or Iran or Thailand. We don't jail people for what they write or for expressing their thoughts and opinions. Donald Trump is president, not king and has NO right to decide what Americans can and cannot read.

3376,"I have no idea how accurate this narrative is - I would be shocked if none of the sources were lying to advance their own interests. Still, if even a little of it is true, the picture it paints of opportunism, infighting and incompetence is shocking. On top of it all is a president who will not be handled, actively resists information to make decisions, and is swayed different directions through the day by the last person he talks to.Really helps put into context the constant mixed messages, abrupt changes in policy and the revolving door of senior staff, many of whom burn out in days or weeks.",January-20-2018,5

3388,"The Trump White House continues to be one of the most newsworthy and controversial entities of our time.  With that said, any book written from an insider's perspective on it will certainly be best seller.  If you watch the news, perhaps 80% of the book will not be a surprise. More, 80% of the book will be a regurgitation of headlines, the various scandals and confirmation of the fall out between various people: Jared and Ivanka's hatred of Bannon.  The other 20% is an insight into Steve Bannon, the opinions of those in the White House and a myriad of stories about how the staff was assembled.  The portrait painted of Bannon is particularly dark. Bannon is an agent of chaos, someone willing and interested in seeing politics as a war of attrition as opposed to an idealistic search for compromise and an evaluation of the best opinions.  The insights into what staff thinks of Trump become almost repetitive: Trump is an imbecile who is temperamental and reflexively spits out policy that is the product of his gut reaction and not intelligent rationalizing.  Although I recommend the book to all, Moore's writing style is often obnoxious.  He over utilizes phrases appropriate for the New Yorker and obnoxious for a mainstream bestseller.  If you can stomach the writing style of an author with a propensity to use SAT vocabulary words, you'll find this book funny, entertaining and a quick read.",January-28-2018,4

If you've been paying attention, you already know that the president of the most powerful country on the planet (for now) is a weak, vain, emotionally unstable, intellectually challenged individual who has none of the qualities--courage, integrity, empathy, curiosity--one would ordinarily look for in a leader. Wolff's portrait merely confirms what is evident even from a distance.What I suppose is new is the revelation that those closest to Trump are all very aware of his deficiencies (though how could they not be?). Whether you find this comforting or even more frightening is, I suppose, a matter of individual judgment. I suspect that his enablers will be viewed with contempt by those who come after us. This book is a useful record of their role in tarnishing America's reputation, and undermining the country's respect around the world.",January-6-2018,5

I believe he wants to improve the Country and leave the presidency on a good note. However he has no idea what he is doing and it shows with daily crazy tweets and reading this book you will see it first hand how bad his presidency really is.This book should be a wake up call to all Citizens of America to go and vote in 2018 and 2020 for someone who is a seasoned politician who actually cares about lower and middle class and not just the wealthy.

It's a swipe at the reportage-for-access political media we have to endure, and no small reminder that POTUS44 was not exactly an effective guy (even if he was smart and generally swell, he's not the saint he tends to get painted as). Politics in the US are presented to us on a simplistic level that a bright child could understand -- as good vs evil, truth vs lies--this book is a reminder that people have agendas and all those names you know are beholden to, or loyal to, somebody else whose name you might not know.

3443,Wow..proof that absolute moron can be elected. The book rambles alot  but fits all the the stupid statements Trump has made on Twitter and on the news. I was going to give the president the beifit of the doubt  till he gave himself a tax break and supported hate. Now...you should read this book...then check his statements...not the news statements but his own statements.  He looks as if he is bi polar even with doctor saying he is ok.  I am long time Republican who voted for Obama because he has grasp on what was wrong but the Republican  party stopped Obama care as it was first submitted to them and all it needs now is to be fixed back to that. As for what to do a bbq out trump...thats not my job. Good reading book.,January-24-2018,4

3445,"First I originally bought this book as an f-u to Trump for trying to dictate what books can be published and sold. However, this book  is worth reading. It's very detailed and well written book about our clownish president and what went on behind the walls. You'll laugh and then cry at the Idiocracy! For example, even if you don't read this book you must read the speech that he gave to the CIA right after becoming president. It is at best incomprehensible. It made me truly wonder if he is severely ADHD as he seems to not be able to complete a complete thought, before drifting into another idea.",January-10-2018,5

All the leaking makes sense now from insights and revelations in the book. Great read.",January-15-2018,5

Provides much appreciated insights into the types of people who attach themselves to this weirdly abrasive/ultimate narcissist/outsider/insider, yet partisan-worshipped, President.  Too bad it wasnâ€™t for his entire presidency, what with the government shutdown and all.  But it was important to get this information out to the public ASAP.  There is likely no one who can complete this full story the way it should be done.",January-20-2018,4
3448,"I have just gotten into it, but am anxious to hear more. Since the author is a writer, not a reporter, he can't be taken literally. I do believe Trump is mentally ill, and also incompetent.

3453,"I teetered between 2 and 3 stars, which means I'm somewhere between ""don't like the book"" and ""it's okay. Here's why. The book was poorly written. Mechanically, there were way too many breaks (commas everywhere) throughout the flow of reading. Combine this with there were too many sophisticated words throughout the whole book, and there were typos and grammatical errors along with that. All these things distracted my attention away from what Mr. Wolff was trying to convey. I ultimately lose interest thus stopped reading the book.To Mr. Wolff: If a reader is spending more time looking up the meaning of words or is constantly re-orientating because there are so many parenthetical notations, they will probably lose interest. I'm sure the material that surrounds the disaster our country is in right now is quite complicated. The task of explaining all this should not involve additional layers of confusion and arcane language.",January-17-2018,3

3463,"Reading this book (Kindle version) is like watching the death throes of a much beloved family member. We all saw what tRump and the tRump Regime have been doing to the United States of America--- this book explains in part why and how the USA is being destroyed by a delusional sociopath, and everyone who loves the country will be greatly saddened by this book.It will be many decades before the rest of the world will trust the United States again after what tRump and The Party have done to the USA's allies.The writing in this book is not excellent; in some places it needs more editing.

Knowing the inaccuracies did nothing to take away from the enjoyment of this book, and to me, the errors are minor, non-material, more innocent mistakes than intentional omission. Nothing compared to the Grand Error in the Oval. Michael Wolff knows how to keep you glued to the narrative. There's foresight here already proving to be deadbolt true.Truth?! Imagine that!

Overall it provides a decent, and plausible story line to understand the ""whys"" behind a lot of the public events we are all familiar with. It is still largely narrative in nature and very few times significantly insightful. It looks as if a significant chunk of it was dictated by Bannon - no one else is given a protagonist point of view in the story.I found the writing style curious. There were long sentences, part separated by commas - and dashes - in ways, just as this, to possibly give a veneer, if not a facade of - not in literal sense - intellectualism.I liked that there were several well used words for which I had to consult the dictionary.",January-8-2018,4

3506,"Where will this nightmare end?  How can any person call this name calling, bully a christian?  His true self that so matches up with the authorâ€™s observances is obvious in his tweets.  Calling all Republicans-The emperor has no clothes!â€ù",January-8-2018,5
3507,Very revealing about how Trump nor the people around him ever considered that he would win the presidency and how uneducated he is,February-28-2018,5
3508,I bought it because I believe in freedom of the press.  It's worth the price to send that message.  Buy it.  Recommend it.  I'm still reading it.  I hope that things change for the better soon.,January-5-2018,5
3509,What a great book.,April-19-2018,5
3510,"I give this book five stars not because Wolff's writing is top-notch, certainly not because he and his assistants took the time to properly proofread the manuscript (it is riddled with minor errors), and not because every bit of it is likely to be absolutely true (can absolute truth be expected from the pack of liars Wolff spent time with in the White House?).  I give it five stars because the book seems to me to reveal basic truths of Trump's not only corrupt but unbelievably WEIRD administration:  1) Trump is a pathological liar; he has hit a new low in dishonesty for the sake of personal and political expediency.  2)  Trump is a seriously unstable narcissist, a poster boy for empty arrogance and entitlement, not sure himself who he is besides a TV character.  3) The man is so intellectually, emotionally, and morally bankrupt that he brings out the worst in everyone around him.  I was not surprised by anything I read in this important book.  But I was shocked.  And upon closing FIRE AND FURY, I was frightened.  The country and the world is in serious danger as long as this clownish dictator-wannabe remains in office.  What have we come to?  Read the book as a first step in understanding what has happened to us and what the country needs to do now:  show Donald Trump out of office any way we can as soon as we can.",January-21-2018,5

3525,Why use such big words? It's like Mr. Wolff went through thesaurus and used such big inane words he could find. It does however reaffirm that Dump needs to go!,February-10-2018,3
3526,"Poorly written, but the incidents described in this book on the Trump White House are scary and well worth a read. A commentary on the mediocrity of the team that made its way to the White House",January-15-2018,4
3527,A must read to see whatâ€™s going on in our country behind the scenes,January-8-2018,5
3528,"This is Interesting reading, but it's  difficult to get past Wolff's quirky writing style. I hold a BSE in English so usually appreciate different writing techniques.  That was not the case with this book.",April-11-2018,3
3529,Real life report. There is another novel after this one was published. So much more. Incredible for the US. An apple is an apple...Fake new! #Fake president. This is why he is so relateble...He lies!,March-25-2018,5
3530,"It was a decent read, nothin should come as a surprise and there wasnâ€™t any great revelation if you have even read the news headlines over the past year.  Good marketing move on the authors part even though he burnt a lot or bridges producing this book.",January-20-2018,4
3531,"To begin with, I was very irritated by all the editing mistakes that appeared in the Kindle edition. Writers lose some credibility when their ""finished"" product is riddled with grammatical errors. This book is just not well-written. At first the account was galvanizing, especially seeing in print one of Trump's speeches--which I would assign a D-minus at best. Incoherent, highly repetitive writing (or in this case Trump's speaking) indicates incoherent thinking; the president does not argue, he asserts. He has anecdotes but no evidence. Facts are clearly anathema to him; logic escapes him. But all this is really no surprise because he has shown himself over and over to be a vain, emotionally needy idiot, who is a compulsive liar being propped up by immoral toadies (in his staff and in congress). That said, after the first 90 or so pages, I became really bored. And why not? Trump (the subject of the book, after all) has nothing to say. He has no plans to solve the country's many problems and seems dangerously susceptible to repeating what the last person he talked to said.",January-17-2018,3
3532,Pretty much what we observe and know but more from the inside. And I believe it's credible and well written.,January-14-2018,5
3533,Learned a lot of new words from this author.  Hate we have such a degraded individual that MUST be exposed - he is an utter embarrassment to the NATION!  Well written book,January-14-2018,5
3534,A kitty kelly type tell all eye opening and a start to a study of what is happening to us,April-1-2018,5
3535,"The book confirms my worst fears about Trump's inability to be President and says little positive about all the others that compose his executive staff.  The attraction to be close to power in the White House most be intoxicating for many people, regardless to who is President.  With his never ending need to be loved, praised, and admired by everyone around him it is hard to believe that he will ever be happy or successful as President.  With so many people who despise Trump it is easy to see how he could turn into a paranoid Nixon/Joseph McCarthy  who think people who don't stand and cheer him are treasonous and the media needs to be silenced.  It doesn't say anything good about our country that his 35% faithful followers believe that he really cares about them when his three most famous words from TV are ""you're fired"".  You can't cut cut taxes and increase the national debt by a trillion dollars and deliver all the things he said in the State of Union Address.  I just wish that more Americans would actually try to read and learn about issues and not just listen to empty sound bites.",February-8-2018,4
3536,A fascinating read and providing great background into what makes Donald Trump tick.  Explains much of the ongoing White House activities that have followed the publication of this book and why Trump and his followers behave as they do.,March-7-2018,5
3537,"Some interesting information about what's been going on behind the scenes with the Trump administration, but it's painfully evident that this book was rushed to press. It is poorly written with so many digressions that following the author's train of thought becomes impossible at times. I read 150 pages, got the gist and moved on.",March-9-2018,2
3538,It is a very unusual book with a lot of insights into this administration. It is worth the read.,March-26-2018,5
3539,"I rolled my eyes while reading it because so much of it was unbelievablely horrible, but everything it said would happen, has actually happened. So it earns its 5 stars from me.",March-5-2018,5
3540,I read the book and enjoyed it-but I think you have to take some of it with a grain of salt !,May-2-2018,5

Considering what poor excuse of a human being you have already proven yourself to be, I doubt anything in this book will actually surprise me.",January-5-2018,5
3543,Interesting but so one sided. Feel like I bought a cheap tabloid paper but it had more pages.,March-20-2018,2
3544,Interesting but all the juicy stuff was on the news.  Confirms it is as bad as we thought. Quick read,March-9-2018,2
3545,Very interesting reading regardless of your opinion of Trump!!!  Found it very entertaining loved it!,March-8-2018,5
3546,Interesting...however it became boring after a while so I could not continue to the end because I feel the writer could have said the same things in a shorter format.,March-12-2018,4
3547,"Writer Michael Wolff understands the instincts, greed and hubris of Trump and people in his inner and outer circle like nobody else does. Trump is an epitome of narcissism and Michael understands that perfectly well. Regardless of whether one believes that some facts may be embellished, this is a must read for anyone who seeks to understand Trump",March-7-2018,5
3548,"This book describes the ineptitude of Trump. His lack of knowledge of the workings of government, his inability to study issues and policies, his lack of knowledge regarding the constitution, his narcissism is all described in this book. What's frightening is the already scary decisions he's made and will continue to make. Let's hope the country will survive him",January-31-2018,5

3554,"Gotta take most political books like this - especially in the era of Trump - with a grain of salt, but so far, everything Michael Wolff asserts in this novel is seemingly accurate....M-MAGA????",March-29-2018,4
3555,"Worth the read, just to get an understanding of who all the players are and where they came from.",March-7-2018,5
3556,Excellent read.,March-7-2018,5
3557,Ordered on Kindle. Weâ€™re at an historic point in the course of our democracy. Will bad actors like Trump dismantle our democracy or will the resistance save it?,March-7-2018,5
3558,I appreciate the expose' qualities of the information but needs editing. Quite repetitive and the author is a bit pompous using unusual and obscure words and language. Most of the interesting information has been adequately discussed by network news. Buy it in paperback,March-7-2018,2
3559,Some of the stuff is interesting and other seem to be very overblown to sale the book.,April-29-2018,3

3565,"Although the subject matter is interesting, Michael Wolfe's writing style is disjointed and often incomprehensible.",February-20-2018,2
3566,"Brilliant writer. But Wolff also knows how to let Trumpâ€™s words speak for themselves. Remember the early speech Trump gave at the CIA? The full speech - verbatim - is in the book. I consider myself fairly well informed about Trump, but a careful read of this speech is one of the most unsettling experiences I have ever had. What is going on in that head of his? That this disturbed man has been elected to any sort of political office, ever, is astounding. Just read the CIA speech carefully if you doubt it.",January-5-2018,5

3572,"This books not only tells the American people how dysfunctional the current administration is, but how 45is not mentally fit to be the leader of this country.  This book does not tell us anything new, it just provides the specific details of who, what, when, where and why.  The sad part is that this country is being operated by billionaires and friends of 45 as illustrated in this book.  This is so sad that I fear for my children, my family and my community.  I pray that this too shall past and whatever lesson God wants us to get out of this is revealed soon.  I pray that all of the division that is created by 44 ends. We have overcome so much in this country to turn back.  We are in a constitutional crisis and we need our leaders to step up and think country over party and preserve our democracy before its to late.",January-15-2018,5

3579,Very interesting,March-19-2018,5
3580,"Well written and worth the time to read. I think Michael Wolff filled in some details he probably couldn't know about to make the book more readable; however, the general issues we have with this president that he details ring true.",January-16-2018,4

3588,Fast interesting reading.,February-27-2018,5
3589,I couldnâ€™t resist buying it against POTUSâ€™ wishes. Trump will be so happy because itâ€™s MADE IN AMERICA and his love of the free press and response of its readers have declared a victory for democracy and its values. Who would have thought?,January-5-2018,5
3590,"I am reading a book about each president, not necessarily a biography though.  I've only just started this book.  It is entertaining and not dry, so that is a plus.  However, Wolff is not at all objective and makes gross assertions that are opinions rather than facts.",May-3-2018,3

3596,"Maybe it's a sign of the times that I read this book with my eyes periodically snapping wide open in incredulity. What would make a voter pick a person like this man as president? Yet the further I read, the more I saw that the current day's mores honor volume rather than sense, and a snake oil salesman more than a statesman. Too, I came to see that this moron would not have become president without an active crew of equally wrong-spirited enablers. It will be a happy day for this country when they all slink back into the obscurity which is their rightful place.",January-11-2018,4

Just an update, after finishing this book, it occurs to me there are so many of us in this country that will absolutely not allow it to become a dictatorship. Anyone who thinks that couldn't happen here needs to study how Hitler came into power. So RESIST! And vote!!",January-12-2018,5

3627,"I didn't actually intend to buy this book until it was ordered not to be published. Mainly I was willing to pay the 15 bucks to support free speech.Other than a few typos, which I found a bit distracting, this was a sobering look at what many of us feared was going on in the White House. Told in a quite matter of fact way that did not seem to be going for shock value or sensationalism made it all the more believable. Combined with quotes from those he interviewed are the author's own impressions. If given a choice to believe a president who has lied every single day about easily fact checked events, and an author who was seen with a visitor pass on a nearly constant basis by white house reporters, I am more inclined to believe the author than a president who claims he wasn't there. There are a few descriptions of events that have been disputed as inaccurate but I don't think an honest mistake here and there (such as similar names being confused) negate the facts. Perhaps these were due in part to a rush to publish a week or so early in response to an attempt from the president to block the publication. Considering the president's desperate attempt to block this publication, and considering the author's statement that some of his interviews are recorded. combined with the fact that nobody is disputing the actual quotes, I find it to be believable. I mean considering the things Trump says in public it is not hard to believe what anyone else would say.",January-15-2018,4

My Trumpian neighbor was cleaning snow from his driveway when I took it out of the mail box.  I opened the package with a flourish and waved the book around for his benefit.  ""This should be a fun read"" said I.  He said ""The NYT says only 50% of it is true"".  My reply...""if 50% of this book is true, the whole Trump family is going to jail!""  He looked sad.I'm only about 50 pages in and it's already a hoot!  This book would make a great gift for friends who like to laugh and be horrified at the same time.I am going to buy a copy to install in my permanent ""Guest Bathroom"" collection between the Complete Works of Shakespeare and Weird NJ.",January-9-2018,5

3639,AS ADVERTISED...A MUST READ FOR ALL....,February-27-2018,5
3640,Very interesting book.,March-7-2018,4
3641,"The meta analysis of this remarkable book by much of the self-flagellating mainstream media, fueled by paranoia about perceived liberal bias, has been silly and superfluous. Five minute segment-opening disclaimers about lack of independent corroboration and surgical dissection of specific quotes, scenes and attributions seem to suggest this is a piece of investigative journalism, which it is not and the author never claims it to be. The Washington Post, New York Times and others are already doing historic and admirable work in this regard.The reader needs to accept this book for what it is, a travelogue of the authorâ€™s journey down the rabbit hole and into the tragic and depraved insanity that is Trumpworld.  We shouldnâ€™t expect triple source corroboration of every anecdote or dialogue any more than we would expect it from descriptions of Aliceâ€™s encounters with the Mad Hatter and various other similarly fantastical characters. It also shouldnâ€™t matter that he insinuated himself into Trumpworld through deceitful flattery. The aggrieved simply had to google â€œMichael Wolffâ€ù or ring Rupert Murdoch if they thought he was there to do a puff piece. Any House of Cards fan knew what Tom was up to.In this context, the author provides us with a remarkably vivid and generally coherent view of the inner workings of one of the saddest and most tragic chapters in this countryâ€™s political history. Most importantly, this view comports very well with the collective narrative of an enormous volume of investigative reporting and other journalistic activity covering this period. The author makes clear that he is providing his own best, and likely imperfect, impression of the details of what transpired but this impression is not presented in a vacuum as a handful of deeply embedded sources, most notably Bannon, Walsh and Nunberg, happily provide extensive on-the-record commentary. Of course, as with even the most intensely sourced investigative piece, the biases of the on-the-record sources will tend to dominate the narrative and it is the discerning readerâ€™s responsibility to account for this.It is worth noting that readers looking to gorge on extra platefuls of salacious quotes will be disappointed. With the exception of a remarkable,extended and highly enlightening tirade by Bannon over Chinese food towards the end of the book and a insult by supposed FOD and party wingman Thomas Barrack, most of oh-my-god quotes were included in the pre-release excerpts and have already made headlines, much like a comedy movie trailer tends to give away all of the best jokes.  In between the hot bits, however, is a rich and engaging retelling of the Shakespearean tragedy unfolding behind the scenes of events we already know extremely well, the campaign, Election Day, the inauguration, the Flynn firing, the Comey firing, the Don Jr meeting and itâ€™s coverup, Charlottesville, etc. Some of the most eye-popping and nauseating parts are verbatim recitations of Trumpâ€™s own words such as the surreal CIA HQ speech or the ping-pong of scripted vs spontaneous Charlottesville comments.I have to give the author credit for getting this reader, as virulent a Bannon-hater as there is on the planet, to almost begrudgingly respect him as a man of passion, insight and purpose, even if to evil ends. Itâ€™s hard not to sympathize with his portrayal of the rest of the clown car brigade, including the Clown-in-Chief, as a bunch of hollow, vain, lightweights with no driving purpose other than their own personal glory and in some cases wealth and essentially no insight of how the sane world views them.One final observation. This book is not the liberal bias affirmation piece you might expect. The author takes repeated shots at the liberal media, Obama, the Clintons, etc. in fact, I have to assume that the diehard MAGA crowd (including Breitbart, the Mercers and Hannity) who quickly rallied around the presidentâ€™s family and banished Bannon to the wilderness over this excerpts from the book, donâ€™t read just as their leader doesnâ€™t read. If they did read this book, even with the most cynical of perspectives, they would have to conclude to their horror that the Jarvanka crowd, the â€œDemocratsâ€ù as the Bannonites call them, have won the battle for the Trumpâ€™s â€œheartâ€ù and dominion over Trumpworld itself.",January-6-2018,5

3644,"A really good and entertaining read of the dumpster fire that is the administration of the 45th president of the United States. Some of the content is conjecture, some corraborate already confirmed scandals, and people were fired over the contents.If you are a Trump supporter, you probably don't want to read it. You should though.",March-22-2018,4
3645,The information about the day to day operation in the white house. I thought the level of the vocabulary used was too high. My husband started using a dictionary as he read but gave up.

3648,"Most of the information in this book has been previously reported in the media.  The book is riddled with errors including names, dates and identities.  The VP and Cabinet were not interviewed.  The sourcing isnâ€™t listed.  The author endows people in the WH with opinions and emotions that are unverifiable.  That being said, considering that much of the information has been previously reported, the book paints a frightening picture of the presidency and perils facing the US with Donald Trump in the WH.",January-11-2018,3

3671,"Sadly, I didn't learn a whole lot new, since the public face of the White House isn't a whole lot different than the private one. Still, I dislike someone trying to sue to keep a book from being published. Lotsa smoke there, Trump! The truly sad part for me is that Bannon is going to look like the smart one once this is all over--being bounced and denounced by Trump may be the only thing that keeps him out of jail when so many others are likely to go. And anyone who understands that what Don Jr., Manafort, and Kushner did with the Russians was treason gains points in my view (and since I hate Bannon, that was *really* annoying!). Note that the only member of the inside circle with military experience understands that you just don't collude with hostile powers to win an election. But apparently that's too hard for the Trump family and hangers-on.",January-12-2018,4
3672,"I thought this would be over the top, but it wasn't.  There was much we saw in the news, but this was the background for these incidents.  I appreciated the openness in describing what happened.  If there were untruths, my sense is they were unintentional.  This fit the well with what we were hearing.  It filled in the blanks. I recommend this.",January-23-2018,5

3674,"Because our White House and the Office of the Presidency is notably under siege by a bunch of dangerous morons, Fire and Fury becomes a must read from the fly on the wall--or potted plant as from Michael Wolff.  The media at large can only give us the daily results. Mr. Wolff fills in how we got there, the who's who of the players and what possible worse to be on the watch from the rest of them.  The book confirms much we came to know...And then some.",January-16-2018,4

3679,"When I buy a book, one of my expectations is that the writer has better grammar than I do.  However, I do understand the publisher rushed the book to print; still it's annoying.  Second, the book starts out interesting where the reader is given a chance to understand the thought process of many in our White House.  Then, around the middle of the book, things start to become dry.  With all that was discussed in the news about the contents of this book, I feel it is akin to when a studio puts out a movie trailer that shows all the best scenes of the movie.Should you read this book? At the price point of $13-$18, it's not a bad purchase if you're looking for some White House gossip.  I never got the sense that much of the information was truth, but, at the same time, I can read the information and think, ""yeah, that's possible.""  If you follow the news and think it's all fake, this book is not necessarily for you.",January-28-2018,3

3685,It is a very disturbing read.  It reinforces for me why he should NOT be our President!,February-25-2018,5
3686,"I slogged through this book. I found Michael Wolff's style hard to read. He overuses commas, so much so that you can actually get lost in a sentence. I actually counted a sentence with 9 commas in it. While the book does provide some interesting insight into the workings of this inexplicably dysfunctional White House, I found it was mostly just a re-living of the seemingly never-ending nightmare that is ""President"" Trump. Mostly, I just wanted the book to be over.You'll learn some interesting facts about the players (most of whom are actually gone at this point because the administration is perpetually crumbling) like Bannon, Priebus, Jared & Ivanka, Flynn, etc. I enjoyed understanding these sinister figures a little bit more.Can't say I'd really recommend this unless you are a masochist.",February-5-2018,3

3694,I believe the book is tame in comparison to what is happening now (4/6/2018). It is will be very interesting to see how conservative America acts in the next 2 years.,April-6-2018,5
3695,I couldn't resist buying this book simply because Donald Trump tried to stop its publication. Maybe I can read a few pages.,January-5-2018,5
3696,"We get so much disinformation out of the Whitehouse it is finally good to get a clear, yet not a surprise, understanding of the ongoing circus there.  Yes, some of the stories may be embellished, but the main themes hod true - we have a dysfunctional leader of the free world and he is not capable of anything but delivering day-to-day chaos.",March-7-2018,5
3697,"After reading the 311 page Senate Judiciary transcript of the review of the Steele dossier and Fire and Fury, I easily saw the truth revealed concerning Russia's interference and the misdeeds of several members of the Trump team as well as the House Intelligence Committee Republican memo .  As soon as I read the memo, I knew what the Senate Judiciary Committee Fire and Fury gave the truth to a complete misrepresentation of the truth attempted in the memo.  I plan to use this book as more revelations appear as Mueller releases more indictments.",February-17-2018,5

What we assume is slanted or erronious from the bias / fake media is actually true.  This man really does not have a clue and gets his jollies from being at the center of a storm.",March-29-2018,4

3719,"White House intrigue, a fly on the wall reporting by a writer who demonstrates his considerable talent in observation, writing, reporting and speculation. This is a view of the inner workings of the Trump administration staff and personnel and their mostly wasted efforts to manage POTUS45. The author craftily hides his own views and appears to rely on direct observation and indirect assessment of the views of others in the White House to complete a story-line that in sum is an indictment of the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave for his general unfitness and lack of temperament to carry out the duties of the Office of President of the United States. Also, it is clear that the specter of the Alt-Right, white supremacist movement remains entrenched as a force in American politics, laid bare with Steve Bannon's unnerving testimony that energizes much of Wolff's narrative.",January-13-2018,4

3748,"This is a five star book with some factual errors but the gist of the book is correct.  Some people might ask how is a book with factual errors worth five stars?  I confess that I'm more liberal than I am conservative, so that might be one reason.  But I am not blind to errors of fact.  I am not deluded.  I do not ignore reality or truth, like some people, and plow on, as if facts don't matter.  For every error in this point, my guess is that our president has told a fifteen or twenty lies.  The President has also not read this book, so how can he call it anything.  How can anyone who has not read book have their comments taken seriously, though the natural line of defense from those who have not read it, but are commenting unfavorably, or favorably here, will be because they can.  This book is important because it is good enough.  And therefore relevant, given its subject.  It does its best to offer significance through relative truth.  And relative truth is important these days because we are combating the very serious dangers if not outright incompetence and possibly even the outright evil of a fake president.  We are enduring the everyday fakeries and racist and narcissistic lies of a fake president.  A president who himself doesn't take truth seriously.  Who has ""legitimized"" his own truth as somehow a prosperously fake truth with his conspiratorial style of leadership.  We can only hold our breath and pray, or meditate, that it will be over soon enough, and that our country will somehow survive.",January-8-2018,5
3749,"This is a great book with a lot of undisclosed information.  Wolff described what went on behind the scenes and who the key players were in the early days of the Trump presidency.  We learned more about what the key player's goals were and I believe the author the absolutely correct.  Clearly, Trump hired the worse and the most incompetent people imaginable to fill his cabinet.

3783,Very informative!!!,April-14-2018,5
3784,"I despise Trump tbh, and I'm a former Democratic State Committeewoman.  I believe he should be impeached (which means charged formally and brought to actual public trial, not removed from office unless convicted).  I suspect we are headed for at least a proxy war with Putin, which would make collaboration traitorous, and a capital offense.Even given that.All you have to do is read Wolff's description of how the NYC literati and press had it out for the man, and his blaming Kushner for the decline and early death of a news editor at a paper Kushner bought (I found Wolff's eulogy for that editor at The Guardian) and a picture emerges.This is a book by a man who believes that his cadre created Trump, in part, and so it is his responsibility to bring him down.There is social engineering, bullying, and snobbery underlying every line.Read this in part as a document of the psychology of the Eastern seaboard self-segregated urban elite who uses the term ""fly-over state"" to refer to the majority of the country by geography.All Democrats are not like this.  I grew up in a rural, agricultural state.  I was born in the Midwest.  But I live in Cambridge MA smack between Harvard and MIT, surrounded by any number of city people who wouldn't know what part of a cow to milk or what that was analogous to on a human, and if they thought too hard they'd never drink milk again.  I am not vegan.But there are a lot of Americans today avoiding thinking too hard about each other's realities.I also found Wolff's writing from back in the Clinton administration dissecting just what it took to push America into accepting that travesty -- and I believe he is taking those lessons and implementing them against a Republican administration.  It's a bed the GOP made and have to accept the short sheets they are sleeping in.  I believe we are finding far graver issues than a stained dress and a single lie here.I am still a liberal and a Democrat, but one determined to see all sides confront their mirrors.  If this is our accepted truth without looking for motivation and nuance, without asking questions regarding the author, then we have a problem regardless of party.  What we have here is a failure to communicate.How do we reunite this country?  This is not the answer.  What this is, is a strategic weapon aiming for hearts and minds.  How can we possibly know how much is true without reviewing audio?",March-22-2018,2

3793,"Trumpâ€™s daily outbursts already create enough anxiety for most Americans and the citizens of the world, but I nevertheless felt it was important to read this book during my ""leisure"" time,Much of the subject matter is nothing new and has been reported extensively during the past year (not-so-spoiler alert:  most of the people who work/have worked with Trump do not believe he's fit to be President).  And all the new ""bombshells"", such as Bannon's comments about the Russian meeting at Trump Tower, have already made the headlines.  The book can be a little gossipy, and Wolff's journalistic reputation is not impeccable, but I believe that the book is mostly true - at least true enough that the overall depiction of the Trump Administration is accurate.Even though all the news-worthy information has already been reported, I am glad that this book was published.  Bumping up the publication date was a great move - Trump needs to be shown that he's now in the big leagues and can no longer bully the little guy by threatening lawsuits.  Plus, he needs to know that he canâ€™t get away with whatever he wants because he was born rich.Regardless of your opinion of the book, it will certainly hold a place in the history of the Trump Administration.",January-13-2018,5

3796,"Just a lot of fun to learn some more of the details of the pathetic person that is agent orange. This account I think is actually rather compassionate toward DT. I have no idea how Wolf was able to fill in all the details, but itâ€™s sure believable. Well written. I give it three stores just based on the subject matter- itâ€™s hard to get beyond three stars when itâ€™s a book about Donald. I do recommend it, as it provides some insights that are certainly true and good fodder to help appreciate the continued drama coming outof the White House. You might want to read this pretty soon as this drama will likely end shortly, to the relief of 2/3 of America.",January-20-2018,3

3806,"Haven't even ""cracked the spine"" of this book yet and yes I know I just put money into the pockets of the author and publishers but $15 is nothing compared to the joy of standing up to any attempt at a police state.  Censorship is just the tip of that sword. It starts with the war on media, press, and critics.  Followed by the ostracizing of any group not white-American. Then advances to the banning of books and Videos that don't shine a favorable light on the Moron in Chief.  Who's Next?  That's easy.... Who's left?",January-9-2018,5

3808,What a great albeit disturbing read! I thought for sure I had already heard everything in the news but then when Trump and company tried to stop the book from being released...well I had no choice at that point but to immediately purchase the book! Iâ€™m glad I did. Itâ€™s a real page turner! I could barely tear myself away to write this review!,January-6-2018,5
3809,"I was surprised to find in reading ""Fire and Fury"" - Michael Wolff's seventh book (I haven't read any of his others), that it was not the lurid secrets revealed that intrigued me most (they were old news by the time I got my back-ordered copy) nor the ""behind the scenes"" descriptions of ""what really goes on in the White House"" that I found to be the most remarkable element of the book, but rather it was the unusual run-on sentences with thoughts streaming in out of the blue, accompanied by a higher density by far of punctuation marks per word per page than other books I was reading at the time, e.g. ""Leonardo"", by Walter Isaacson, so different that I thought I would write this review (posted on both Amazon and LibraryThing using a similar style throughout to give you an idea of what you will frequently encounter should you decide to read it.  Of course, I could just reproduce a sentence or two, and in fact, I do that in the paragraph immediately below, but a few sentences, standing alone in a rather twisted weave, does not convey the same effect as a books-worth, and if you doubt my words, you may wish to stop at a bookstore and leaf through some random pages, or even easier, go to Amazon's review page and take a look at some of the ""Look Inside"" material.Here's Wolff, beginning page 161, bottom paragraph:For Breitbart, the House rebellion and transformation that had driven the former Speaker, John Boehner, from office, and which, plausibly, was set to remake the House into the center of the new radical Republicanism had been halted by Ryan's selection as Speaker.  Mitt Romney's running mate, and a figure who had merged a conservative fiscal wonkishness - he had been chairman of the House Ways and Means committee -with an old-fashioned idea of unassailable Republican rectitude, Ryan was the official last, best hope of the Republican Party. (Bannon, typically, had turned this trope into an official Trumpist talking point: ""Ryan was created in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation."")(Want more? try bottom of page 144 and just continue until....)Too often, I had to stop and go back to re-read, searching for the elusive main thought that had somehow escaped me, and coming away feeling I was reading a first draft, something rushed to take advantage of a marketing window (though whether that was the case or not I had no idea), and while this became the main negative of this book for me, it was not alone.  I'm certainly no prude and have no issues with salty language when used in appropriate circumstances, but I thought it was overdone here; I certainly have no illusions about the level of language used in almost all organizations including the White House and a few examples make the point, but I thought it was a bit overdone(and the author even feels it necessary to clarify ""repetitions"" as it applies to Trump's speaking skills or lack thereof), and speaking of overdone I wondered why Wolff found it necessary to make 4 uses of ""Catholic"" between pages 55 and 57 in describing Bannon's background; I found that rather strange and a bit overdone.There were some positives, little things mostly like the juicy bits about the Hicks-Lewandowski relationship and Bannon's (and apparently Wolff's) not too flattering assessment of Hope Hicks's abilities and then there's the frequent negative shots at Ivanka, and now I can stop having nightmares about her ever becoming POTUS, but then that was exactly the same I thought of her father two years ago.....OMG!  There was an especially funny line I hadn't heard before spoken by our President, per page 98, bottom:""They take everything I've ever said and exaggerate it,"" said the president in his first week in the White House during a late-night call.  ""It's all exaggerated.  My exaggerations are exaggerated.""Nikki Haley is compared to X in terms of her ambitions, and it's a hilarious comment - you'll have to read the book to find it (hint pg 309).  And I thought the descriptions of the first weeks in the White House were very interesting.  Not a lot that was new, but confirming my worst imaginings, somehow reading it as it actually happened was more unnerving than I thought it would be and I thought Wolff did a good job of describing the chaos that ruled and the sheer amateurism that prevailed.  So, would I recommend this book?.....you have to ask....absolutely not, I even feel my 3 star rating is overly generous and would I read a follow on book?, hell yes and don't ask me to explain why.",February-15-2018,3

3824,"If you deplore Donald Trumpâ€™s racism, misogyny, meanness, stupidity, narcissism, and recklessness, and the sheer incompetence ofÂ his White House, as I do, and if there is a malicious streak in you, as there is in me, you may love Michael Wolffâ€™s Fire and Fury. It's difficult to imagine any account of the goings-on in Donald Trumpâ€™s White House that would paint a darker picture of this worst of all Presidents and the servile minions around him. Fire and Fury is scathing.Other reviewers have panned this bookHowever, far better writers than I have reviewed this book and found it wanting. Here, for example, is Masha Gessen writing in The New Yorker (January 7, 2008): â€œTheÂ President of the United States is a deranged liar who surrounds himself with sycophants. He is also functionally illiterate and intellectually unsound. He isÂ manifestly unfit for the job. Who knew? Everybody did.Â So why has a poorly written book containing this information, padded with much tedious detail, become an overnight sensation, a runaway best-seller, and the topic of every other political column, podcast, and dinner conversation? It seems we are in bigger trouble with reality perception than we might have realizedÂ . . .Â That â€˜Fire and Furyâ€™ can occupy so much of the public-conversation space degrades our sense of reality further, while creating the illusion of affirming it.â€ùIn a similarly unflattering review in the San Francisco Chronicle (January 9, 2018),Â Book Review Editor John McMurtry describes Fire and Fury as â€œa few hundred pages of gossipy, anecdote-heavy accounts that paint a highly unfavorable portrait of a deeply unpopular president . . . Of course, as with any satisfying dish that has you craving more, the book, with all its accounts of petty and profanity-infused backstabbing, can ultimately leave you with the feeling of having consumed one too many of Trump's beloved cheeseburgers.â€ùDespite the bad reporting, a terrible truth emergesItâ€™s difficult to disagree with any of this. Surely, Fire and Fury is a product of very bad reporting. But strip away the flimsy analysis, the nasty innuendo, the unattributed zingers, and the opinionated diatribe, and you're left with an indictment of Donald Trump that is still likely to shock anyone who is not immersed 24 hours a day in the seething cauldron of political news. The picture that emerges from even a skeptical reading of Fire and Fury is horrific. Everything I had come to believe about Donald Trump has been confirmed:Â Our president is an impulsive man of limited intelligence, a racist, a sexual predator, a pathological liar, and an unrelenting narcissist who almost never listens and never accepts criticism.What I learned from Fire and FuryStill, I learned a few things from Fire and Fury:Donald Trump never wanted to be president, and he was stunned when he won. His campaign was a brand-building exerciseâ€”a way for him to make a lot more money. â€œHe would come out of this campaign, Trump assured [former Fox News chairman Roger] Ailes, with a far more powerful brand and untold opportunities. â€˜This is bigger than I ever dreamed of,â€™ he told Ailes in a conversation a week before the election. â€˜I don't think about losing because it isn't losing. We've totally won.â€™â€ùPractically everyone on the White House staff, including his daughter and son-in-law, treat Trump like a willful two-year-old. Almost nobody ever says no to him. Those rare occasions when anyone does so trigger tantrums and vicious backbiting from the president. He even badmouths his daughter and son-in-law.All this may be old hat to you, if you obsessively follow the daily news. I donâ€™t.How did Michael Wolff ever get access?Â I find it astonishing that anyone in a senior position in the White House, much less the president himself, would allow a man with Michael Wolffâ€™s reputation as a scandal-monger to set foot in the place, let alone hang out with them for eighteen months. But Edward Helmore has an explanation (The Guardian, January 14, 2018): â€œAfter writing relatively positive profiles of Trump and Bannon for the Hollywood Reporter, Wolff joined the parade of job-seekers and ring-kissers at Trump Tower in the weeks after the astonishing election result. â€˜I said to the president, â€œIâ€™d love to come down and be an observer at the White House.â€ù Thatâ€™s when he thought I was asking for a job. I said, â€œNo, no. I might want to write a book.â€ù His face fell. He was completely uninterested. So I pressed a little. Iâ€™d really like to do it. So it was, â€œYah, yah. OK sure.â€ùâ€™â€ùWhat's missing from Wolffâ€™s reportingOne more thing about the book: in any serious effort at political analysis or reporting, itâ€™s customary to include notes, usually extensive ones, about the sources of the author's information. There are no notes in Fire and Fury. Nor does Wolff date the conversations he reports having had or learned about. This is exceedingly sloppy reporting.And hereâ€™s a taste of how Wolffâ€™s peers in journalism look at him. â€œItâ€™s unsurprising that, as a former colleague delicately puts it, â€˜people really canâ€™t stand Michael.â€™â€ù So wrote Michelle Cottle in the New RepublicÂ more than a decade ago (August 29, 2004). She continued: â€œWhat is surprising is how much of the animus seems unrelated to the content of his commentary. On a meta level, Wolff is resented for not playing by the rules of his chosen profession. He has a reputation for busting embargoes and burning sources by putting off-the-record comments on the record.â€ùAbout the authorFrom Wikipedia: â€œMichael WolffÂ is an American author, essayist, and journalist, and a regular columnist and contributor toÂ USA Today,Â The Hollywood Reporter, and the UK edition ofÂ GQ.Â He has received twoÂ National Magazine Awards, aÂ Mirror Award, and has authored seven books.â€ù (Do you wonder how he managed to win those awards? I do.)One of Wolff's earlier books, Burn Rate, chronicled his effort in the 1990s to become a multimillionaire on the Internet. The book was panned by many reviewers, just as has been the case with Fire and Fury. And those reviews suggest thereâ€™s nothing new in Wolffâ€™s style or approach to his subjects. Here, for example, is Katie Hafner, writing about Burn Rate in the New York TimesÂ (July 26, 1998): â€œWolff spares no feelings. He casts such an unforgiving eye on the people around him that his tone often smacks of vendetta. He depicts his cohorts as fakes and blowhards, arrogant and clueless. He is locked in a hate-hate relationship with one of his main investors, who Wolff believes is out to double-cross him. Wolff portrays his partner as a wealthy, simpering venture capitalist wannabe, and makes disagreeable sport of deceiving him. It is this dark figure who eventually strips Wolff of control of his own company.â€ù",January-18-2018,3

3871,Was curious...absolute garbage and I am not a Trump fan.,April-19-2018,2
3872,Not difficult to read ~ wish it had more verifiable quotes.,March-9-2018,4
3873,"After 18 months of a narcissist bullying his way into office I am glad to see the press and this author present a more realistic view of this presidential embarrassment. I see POTUS blindly bullying his way OUT of office so that we can get a true unifier in place (and it certainly ain't that token Pence ""brown noser""). After reading the first two chapters of this book , as an editor myself, I am surprised at how well-written this thing is. A real page turner. I am a verified purchaser and I'm glad I bought this book.",January-7-2018,5
3874,"I think is a ligth version of whats really happening inside the chaotic WH, very interesting references, in real life is to much worst.",March-7-2018,5
3875,"Purchased for many reasons.  Wanted to support the resistance, wanted to read more crap on this horrible president and wanted to piss 45 off.  I think by buying this book i accomplished all three.  Everyone needs to vote in November. NO MORE EXCUSES!",January-8-2018,5
3876,"Inferiority complex encased in superiority complexBehaves horribly but wants to be adoredWants attention from the media but bashes them on a daily basisComes from old money but uncultured, uneducated, boorish, unsophisticated.Trump is his own polar oppositeThis man is clinically mad",January-6-2018,5
3877,Nothing revealed will come as a huge surprise to anyone who follows the headlines and/or has read the transcripts of Trump's interviews.  It would have been a lot more fun to read if the stakes weren't so high....,January-7-2018,5
3878,"You'd have to live on another planet to not have heard all the things this book ""reveals"". I suppose I didn't like it because I'm so very disappointed with the views this White House projects. The negativity is exhausting!",March-21-2018,3
3879,"I bought it because tRump tried to stop it. I read it because I wanted to know what the fuss was about. I finished it because I wanted to see how well it corroborated the news and media. There didn't appear to be anything earth shattering here, though it was an enjoyable read. I didn't much like the writing style... a bit too tabloidy for me. I prefer the work and style of Woodward. It was a bit difficult following all the characters, but that's tRumpland isn't it... full ofcharacters",January-22-2018,3
3880,what i liked most is that it give you a true look inside trump white house that we wouldn;t have without iti couldn't find anything that i didn't like about this book,April-29-2018,5
3881,Came as expected and the price was good to. Thanks Amazon.,March-7-2018,5
3882,What a great book. I was stuck at the airport most of the day. This totally made my day. It's like a train wreck you can't look away. Total dumpster fire.Truth is I don't really like political books; this is well written and a real nice casual read. Even if it's only half true; damn entertaining.,January-5-2018,5
3883,Fascinating read.,February-14-2018,5
3884,"I found it interesting but a little spacey. It also troubled me that the author stated that there were truths and untruths in the book. I feel if you write non-fiction, you should not include unverified information just to stoke curiosity. I do believe that many of the things written probably happened in one way or another.",February-4-2018,3

3886,Interesting reading!,April-15-2018,5
3887,My husband really enjoyed reading Fire And Fury.,March-18-2018,4
3888,"Holy smokes! What I liked about ""Fire and Fury"" is the unbelievable access and detail of that access. While there seems to be much controversy around the author's methods and the content itself, I found I could easily navigate that dynamic by keeping in mind the book's clear disclaimers and using some common sense, ""grain of salt"" and, most importantly, the existing facts on the ground. I found this style (some are calling gossipy and tabloid) to be an oddly appealing aspect of the read, refreshing even, but with a strange aftertaste. All told an EXTREMELY riveting yet highly disturbing read depicting an historically troubled administration. I think anyone following this unbelievable saga will appreciate this story. All that said, I won't be truly satiated until a ""tell all"" from the likes of John Kelly or Mattis comes out or a Walter Isaacson or Bob Woodward type chronicles what has happened here.",January-6-2018,5
3889,I know this will be an interesting and entertaining read....,March-5-2018,5

3895,Oh my god!  How can this moron be President?  It is so much worse than even the clear public record shows. All we can do is hope America survives this. That and vote all the enabling traitors out in 2018.May they all go to prison as Muellerâ€™s indictments of a sitting President and all his cronies reasserts the rule of law in America.,January-12-2018,5

3922,This book belongs to my husband and he is reading it now.,February-26-2018,4
3923,...a more in depth account than what is usually served in media. It appears no one is intentionally bad; only unprepared and out of their depth.,January-27-2018,4
3924,I was not surprised by what was in the book. We all know what a corrupt mess this administration is. The problem with the book is that the author is just not that good a writer.  And there is a lot of innuendo about stuff that he has no proof.  I dislike Trump so much is comes as a stress every day when I  get up and hear what other nonsense he has done to embarrass the country.,March-22-2018,2
3925,"This book is shocking and very important.  When history looks back, this book will serve as a signpost for the warning signs we should have seen in our democracy.",February-24-2018,5

3932,"Regardless of your political persuasion, you'll want to read this book. If you are a Trump foe, you will read this book and understand you were right all along - but there was never any doubt. However, if you're a Trump supporter, you'll really want to read this book so that you'll have a firmer grasp of just how clearly you were duped and that you voted against your own interests. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has an interest in politics.",January-12-2018,5
3933,I was going to purchase this book but when the person sitting in the White House thinks it's appropriate to try to halt it's publication that was the end for me.  This is a democracy not a dictatorship even though with this current administration all of this is being tested.  Nothing surprising in this book really just more caothic then I had imagined.  We need a change in this administration it has to go it has been proven that it isn't going to get any better.,January-9-2018,5

3941,"Not perfect but worth the read. Mostly rehashed rumors we already knew but some eye opening new revelations as well. If you are interested in the Trump administration for any reason, a good read. Mainly, it confirmed all I had already suspected.",January-13-2018,4
3942,Great!,March-7-2018,5
3943,WOW,March-4-2018,5
3944,"Cannot put it down!  It's like the CliffsNotes of the past 18 months of DJT's reign of stupidity and recklessness.  Nothing surprising, but horrifying to see it all compiled into one book.",January-6-2018,5
3945,kind of slow and outdated almost every day,April-3-2018,5
3946,not as exciting as I was hoping it would be...,April-1-2018,3
3947,A fascinating read with lots of details backed up in recent news.,March-10-2018,5

3949,"My excuse for buying this book was that I rarely buy gossip mags or the Enquirer. This book was my once-a-decade dive into drivel.However, it doesn't really matter what paper you buy nowdays, anyway. No matter how respected and revered a newspaper is, it might as well be the Enquirer. Remember when people didn't like the president's policies but at least the president had policies? Good times. Was that when America was great?It's entertaining in a trashy way, kind of like a...sorry, I usually have the best words, but now they seem to be running away so that they don't have to be in this review. Frankly, all the West Wing needs is an '80's Joan Collins.At any rate, only read this if you need to cry but you can't. It works as well as ""Beaches"" does at setting tears free.Two stars were maybe too generous.",March-12-2018,2
3950,Good read!,March-4-2018,5
3951,Odd that I'm giving 5 stars to a book about the worst president in the history of our nation.,April-17-2018,5
3952,everything that was in the book is coming true in real time.  He really was spot-on on every personality and every relationship.  What baffles me is that Trump supporters twist themselves into pretzels trying to explain his motivation what the real truth is that he is just a CRAZY ANAL ORIFICE !,March-16-2018,5

3959,"If you have been following the political news, there is nothing in this book that with surprise you. Some of the detail is interesting. Overall, it is supportive of my worst fears. The President is not cut out to be the leader of a democratic republic. Many of his ideas are worth discussion, but he doesn't have the ability to sell them, and can not attract the quality of people to help him. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the ability to realize it. I voted for him. I shouldn't have!",January-14-2018,3
3960,Great book. Author had total access. I found it humorous and demonstrative that Trump should not be the President.,April-3-2018,5
3961,"Apparently an excellent insight into what is going on inside Trump's brain. While some parts have to be taken with a grain of salt, the issue of how Trump makes decisions is evident.It is likely going to be the book that will be brought up when he faces any justice. The behavior he has demonstrated in the book is one that will be mentioned again and again.Worth the read, and for those who are ignorant, it is a mind changer.",March-21-2018,5
3962,"I purchased this book to support freedom of the press and my freedom to read whatever I choose. Thank you Mr. Wolff for your very entertaining book, I hope it stays on the best seller list until our next presidential election.",January-5-2018,5

3968,"They hyped this book more than it should've been. I don't think the so-called insinuated love affair between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley was truthful. Other instances may have been embellished.I'm not a fan of Donald Trump but this book maybe "" fake news"". I am very disappointed.",February-20-2018,2

3973,"I bought 20 copies of this book for one reason: Nobody tells me what I can read and not read. 45 wants to ""fix"" the libel laws in this country? Check it off list of Authoritarism moves this man has pulled. I count the main 5.The tools of Authoritarianism (such as Putin and Erdogan, 2 of 45â€™s favorite leaders)1 Claim that any investigations of you are a fraudulent and being conducted by enemies of the state. (Mueller/FBI)2 Get your State run media (Breitbart, FOX etc) to echo this message into your base and motivate them to turn against those investigating you.3 Get your partyâ€™s State government (Râ€™s on the Hill)  to echo this same message questioning those investigating you.4 Call for the prosecution of your political enemies (Billary) to deflect attention from you.Good job 45 and co! Itâ€™s working. Odds of impeachment slipped again today from 40% to 39%. (Now 33)Ok, Iâ€™m an admitted lefty. I watch at least one hour of State TV every day. I suggest those of you to my right, to watch 1 hour a week of Commie News. Iâ€™m not asking for you to watch Maddow, or Deadline Whitehouse, but do consider watching at least Brian Williams at 11pm EST. Heâ€™s the most moderate of the group with an experienced and smooth delivery.I know itâ€™s hard to turn on MSNBC but I suffer thru STV (Fox), you should suffer thru Williams. Come to the dark side! Itâ€™s all peace, love, and lollipops, youâ€™ll see!  Besides, all this cajoling youre seeing?

A few months into 45â€™s â€œtenureâ€™ I became more and more upset. Then DACA. That did it. Heartless, mean spirited, old white angry people did this. Well, Im an old white angry person too but I have a HEART. That day I went down and registered as a D. My family is livid. Too bad. Im just saying, we ARE turnable. All we need is a beating heart and a pair of eyes to see whats happening, and you too can turn ANGRY RED to Cool Bloo. Im a 60's teen, and so I close with this: WHAT IS WRONG WITH A LITTLE PEACE AND LOVE?? Isn't that the point? That is the point for ME anyhow. IMHO. ""New Blue"" OUT.",January-7-2018,5

I got the audible to listen to while hiking just to make sure I would make time for it and wouldn't miss it.It's fairly clear that these guys have been inept from the start, but it's lovely seeing it all collected into one place and to watch them rage all over Twitter and other media outlets about the exposure.EVERY American should read this book.Trump isn't going to censor America, and he needs to get a grip or move on and retire on some golf course, which is where he already should be 24/7/365. Obviously, it's where he'd rather be, anyways. I just hate paying for it.",January-7-2018,5

3990,"A great read of political back room antics. So many amateurs and rookies and one psychopathic narcissist they all serve. I recall when Republican's cared about social issues and the common working man. Allowing this real estate broker and serial philanderer to lead this great, diverse, strong, and mighty nation into ruin is a shame to the once proud and patriotic Republican party. I also recommend the historical political work of Lawrence O'Donnell, Playing With Fire: The 1968 Election and the Transformation of American Politics.

4007,"Well written, very well paced. Content seems convincing and not surprising to anybody who followed the news. The ""Jarvanka"" bits are slightly removed, it's clear, that the author did not have direct access to their camp. The media-gossip and media-analysis seems lacking a bit. Ailes, Murdoch, the Mercers - their agenda seems to be a white supremacist one. Or an anglo-saxon-Christian one? I think that could have been said out loud, the overall wish to limit and restrict - to keep the undesirables out. This book is about the broad strokes, I would love to get a sequel with more detail as to how the staffers hard work and long days went in that incredible dog-eat-dog-atmosphere. The book does not give a final analysis as to what should happen. And thus it also doesn't point out, that the USA is still standing, after one year of war by nationalist, racist Bannon and oligarchic greed inside the presidency. It is an open window into this war - I recommend it highly..",January-7-2018,5

4079,"Itâ€™s a fun if slightly tabloid read. I have no reason to question the overall slant of the narrative here, and in honesty, the level of shrieking from the White House over it lends it a greater air of credibility than it might otherwise have. Nobody screams that loud, with such little substantive criticism, if you havenâ€™t struck a nerve.",January-11-2018,5
4080,"The book was definitely entertaining. There were several typos, and certain assertions seem questionable. My recommendation is to read it, if you are able to take much of it with a grain of salt.",March-17-2018,3

4090,"I haven't finished it.  The book is very hard gong and quite boring.  Doesn't say anything that we don't already know.  I thought that it would shed some light on how Trump managed to get elected, but am still as puzzled as ever.  I'm sorry I bought this book.",March-8-2018,2

4095,"$15 is a pittance investment in The First Amendment. Kudos to Henry Holt Publishing for advancing the release date.None of this horrifying material is shocking if youâ€™ve spent a week on Twitter watching it unfold in real time. Wolff provides a stallworth journey through the catastrophic CF that is Trump and his chronically colluding denizen of Republican covfefes. By chapter 7, the â€˜Gorilla Channelâ€™ satire trending this weekend isnâ€™t simply plausible, itâ€™s cursory in context.Wolff did over 200 interviews and claims to have tapes (hopefully a nice Audible edition) rendering the scattered trembling Trumplesphereâ€™s awkward opposition attempts irrelevant. Bravo to Amazon for deleting their predictable neophyte attempts to sabotage the reviews.Upon closer inspection of the bookâ€™s entirety, the American public is offered a classic tipping point: to stand up and cease shirking our inherent 100% full responsibility to own our democracy. Every single day that a Republican controlled congress allows that thing and all he represents to remain in office is entirely our fault. Itâ€™s â€œWe the People, â€œ not the â€œUs v Themâ€ù we have allowed the fraudulent leaders of this country to narrate to us as so chronologically detailed in this book.Read it, twice. Never again will anyone ever have the credibility, power, or authority to make you flinch in the face of our collective responsibility to remove from office, every single person outlined in this book. Republicans have had carte blanche control over the national narrative for decades. This book, our national shame detailed and recorded, terminates their tenure.",January-6-2018,5
4096,"An intriguing look into a presidency that most of us thought implausible, at the least. It is difficult to believe that everything written in here is true, but one thing is for sure, it is equal parts entertaining and alarming.",January-11-2018,5
4097,"I'm only on the 4th chapter, but I like the ""inside ""viewpoint & info we'd never know.",March-7-2018,5
4098,"Itâ€™s not a â€œMommy Dearestâ€ù tell-all book, but a carefully executed telling of the back story behind many of the events Iâ€™ve already heard about.  No great revelations or big surprises. It was good to hear some of the things that went on behind the scenes.  I also appreciated a closer look at the many individuals that have passed through the West Wingâ€™s revolving door. Well written (the audio book was well narrated) and a sad confirmation of what we already know.",January-7-2018,5

4102,"I voted for Trump, but wasn't happy about it. Our choices weren't good. That being said, I was not impressed at all by this book. Most of it was not news to anyone who keeps up with political current events. I do believe the author's claim that Trump didn't really think he would win, which seems woefully obvious when you look at how unprepared he was, and still is, since he did. The book was a very boring slog of a read, it was hard to actually finish it. I managed, but the hype for this book didn't really match what it is, just speculation by the author on why Trump operates the way he does, and the unqualified people he's surrounded himself with in the White House.",April-13-2018,2

4118,"No really surprises to hear about the drama behind the closed doors of the White House.  Itâ€™s like an episode of 90210 with all the teenage behavior.  If anyone reads this and is shocked, theyâ€™ve had their heads in the sand.  Long read that probably could have been summed up in half the pages.",April-7-2018,2

I could not keep all the characters straight (who was who).  I disliked Trump during the campain and more so since.I still find it hard to understand anyone who could believe in him and want him as their president.  What a contrast to Obama's personality (which I greatly admired).The book was well written but very critical and not very analytical (for me).For others, if you can stand it and hold your nose, you might be glad you read it.

4149,"I finished the book. I think it's a worthwhile read. The Trump presidency is confusing. It was interesting to get some context beyond the daily scandals into the key players and turnover. I found the less inflammatory parts of the book the most interesting for this reason. Trump is constant contradiction, this book puts forward a reasonable explanation for the chaos. I'm sure it's not completely accurate, but how could anything be in an administration that seems to be making it up as they go along.The main negative complaint I have is the writing itself, especially in the first quarter or so of the book. There is so much clunkiness. The word choices are awkward. It's like it was written by a 14 year old with a thesaurus trying to sound sophisticated. It gets somewhat better later and I made it through, but I wasn't impressed.",January-11-2018,4

4188,"Thoroughly enjoyable. Wolffâ€™s writing is fluid and diction is spot on. I picked up many new vocabulary words.

How can he when everything that is made by him, or his daughter, is made overseas?  His way of speaking, his manners, the way he treats others ( his wife included!), everything he does, brings shame to our country.  I am ashamed and embarrassedthat he is the so called 'president' .  I believe this book tells the truth, why else did he attack it?  That is why I bought it.

I would recommend it to anyone who questions his actions so they can get a clear picture of what a con man he really is. Fire and Fury pretty well say's it all.,February-4-2018,4

4207,"I just finished reading ""Fire and Fury"" by Michael Wolff. I highly recommend it (or the audio version {perhaps his sentence structure would be more easily understood when read by the writer than was deciphered by this reader}) A reminder that what we are experiencing from Washington is simply politics. As it has always been, and will probably always be. Something so foreign to my operating in life, and yet undeniable. Strangely comforting - if you are looking for a provocative, timely read,",January-8-2018,4

4210,"The book is good and I believe it to be factual. I feel that the author could have found more common words to express himself. Words such as opprobrium, solipsism, and revanchism are over the top and caused this reader to stumble. I understood what was meant but those sort of words feel heavy and stop the flow of the read. Maybe it is symbolic and Michael Wolff enjoys the idea that Trump will have to use a dictionary in order to read it.",January-20-2018,4

I personally agree with the bias, but it would be even more effective if the blatant overstatements and bias were removed.  I object to being told how people must think and what their thoughts are.

4238,"Read the published excerpts -- they well-represent the entire book.  Loaded with both quality referenced material and eye-opening confidentially-sourced quotes, the author does a great job at capturing the overall flavor of the Trump campaign and the start of his Presidency.  A true non-fiction page-turner, I find little padding here.  In fact, the many lines of intellectual inquiry that interweave in the complexities of sociopolitical reality have been expertly managed in this book -- no major facets of the Trump era have been ignored, and no significant threads forgotten or untraced.  A literate, relevant, shocking marvel, its place already cemented in world history.",January-6-2018,5

4251,"I wonder how many of the people that voted for Trump regrets their vote. I tell you they are getting what they deserve. Unfortunately, those of us who didnâ€™t vote for him are getting what they deserve too. How could the undereducated and so- called conservative intellectuals not see that Trump is just an old fashion con artist. They could not see he was â€œplayingâ€ù them for fools. He was never a good businessman, husband or even politician. They will get it, when things go sour in this country and, they will go sour. The people who voted for Trump will point their fingers at Obama, the Democratic Party and liberals and blame them for the trouble that Trump caused. But what they must remember is when people point a finger at you, there are three pointing back at them. Republicans remember Donald Trump and everything he does you own. You elected him with a lot of help from Russians. You own him.The book was a good one except for a few typos. I believe if you had no plans to read it, you should change those plans. Itâ€™s a great book.",January-29-2018,5

4320,Just ok. Blah blah blah,February-21-2018,5
4321,"The book reads like a thriller, with the same pacing and suspense. The fact that it's nonfiction is a tribute to the author's talent and skill and his ability to take the reader inside the utter bedlam of the trump administration. People who follow the news will feel a kind of validation that what they suspect about trump and his cronies is not only true, but worse than what they thought. The bottom line here is that trump tried to kill the publication of this book - and the publisher brought it out four days earlier because the first amendment is still alive and well in the U.S. in spite of trump's efforts to kill it and everything else that we associate with democracy.  By the end of the book, there's little doubt that trump doens't govern. He reacts. He's a narcissist who's unfit for the  job.I hope the book sells millions of copies and that at least some of those copies are bought by trump supporters. They're the ones who are being screwed by the administration's policies and the antics of a republican congress that consists of cowards. Trump has tapped into the darkest pockets of the American psyche and this book lays it out.",January-5-2018,5
4322,"Itâ€™s a chooking experience that my feelings around Trump is confirmed, he really acts as a teenager.But the book feels a bit speculative and you really get a feeling that some part is not quite occurate.And at the end you feel that the auther reapeat himself.",March-22-2018,3

Most sentences are convoluted and hard to follow.  There are so many extraneous phrases added that it is hard to read.  Moreover, the author apparently owns quite a robust thesaurus.

Obvious sentence structure and grammatical errors should have been caught immediately and corrected by the copy editor. It was published and released in a hurry. I've thus far only read the free preview pages, but just downloaded the purchased e-book to my reader. I'm sure it has plenty of hyperbole and rhetoric, and a very decisive liberal spin.

There isn't much doubt left about its veracity, and watching all of the stuff unfolding now, hell, the book may be written like a gossip column, but I couldn't put it down until I was done, a few days later, Bannon was served.",January-19-2018,5

If you consider Trump an egocentric naif with no self-control, you can read this book for validation that there are others who feel the same way, but don't expect it to contain any new information. The writing wasn't compelling, nor was I pulled in by the author's blanket statement excusing himself from attributing his ""facts.""

4495,"Reading this book was an exercise in fascination, shock, and dismay.  I haven't been a big fan of 45 but I thought perhaps I had missed something.  I ended up feeling vaguely sorry for him but was truly alarmed by Steve Bannon and his rabidly conservative ideals and Jared/Ivanka Trump's level of access and influence as non-elected members of the executive branch.  With all of the vitriol and constant chaos as (it seems, accurately) portrayed by the press, in my mind there was not a clear agenda nor political ideology nor path forward.  This book explains why and the forces that blew DJT into the White House.I found the author to be credible, even-handed, and politically astute.  His vocabulary was a delight.  I am only giving it 4 stars because there should have been better editing.  Too many typos for a national bestseller!I am glad I read it.

A little overkill in the snooty I know all them big words. No seriously a few are not words...YET. I believe it is mostly  true because we see the palace intrigue unfold further. I never liked Trump even when he was in his 30s. He's never been a 10 like he likes to tell others. He's maybe a 5 on his best day back when. Now he's a shallow, hollow, soulless bubbling old fart who tried to make himself great again. His entourage of liars and wannabe politicians is a joke. Like someone said watch CNN and this is the daily narrative. Nothing in this book is a shocker to me. I don't hate the book but am glad I got the Kindle version so I could delete it once done. Not worth dusting. Now if Melania writes a book in Slovenian about her life with the Orange Baboon I will certainly buy a copy. Worth a read.",March-10-2018,3

4520,"Most of us, if weâ€™re honest, will admit to having passed along gossip. And, Iâ€™m pretty sure most of us have been the subject of gossip. And if youâ€™ve ever worked in a political environment you know how insidious and destructive gossip can be - particularly when itâ€™s â€œweaponizedâ€ù by workers seeking to make themselves look better to the boss by making co-workers look worse. Workplaces like this are really â€œtoxicâ€ù and soul-destroying.This is the workplace environment described by Michael Wolff in his book about the Trump WhiteHouse - â€œFire and Fury.â€ùReaders will sort through his material to decide whatâ€™s true, whatâ€™s exaggerated, whatâ€™s twisted, and whatâ€™s an outright lie. But the one thing that seems indisputable is that the White House is a terrible place to work. Just about everybody is trying to take advantage of the presidentâ€™s lack of awareness to advance themselves at the expense of others. And it seems he can be easily manipulated by persons with hidden agendas.Thatâ€™s my big takeaway from this book.",January-21-2018,3

4533,Good read about the Trump chaotic presidency.,March-11-2018,4
4534,"Wolff has pulled together an engaging and reasonably well-written case for what has already been quite obvious to anyone paying attention: the story of the workings, or rather the lack thereof, of the Trump White House is one of warring personalities, each less experienced, less self-aware, and more incompetent than the next. Fire and Fury largely serves as a 'greatest hits' list of dysfunction and scandal, a reminder of just what a long and dark year for American government we've all suffered through at the hands of the Character in Chief and his supporting cast.To be sure, there are tidbits of new information, mostly in the form of the gossip and quotes attributed to (and almost surely sourced from) Bannon that have now been exhaustively reprinted in the press since the book's release. While there has been much discussion of the accuracy or inaccuracy of specific quotes or anecdotes, the very nature of a drama that is more about people and relationships than actions means that the story will, as Wolff acknowledges in the preface, necessarily be coloured by the biases and agendas of the sources doing the telling.Still, the core thread of an unstable and fragile president surrounded by bumbling, infighting, and sycophantic staff has been so clearly and publicly on display that it hardly presents itself as a revelation or a matter for dispute. Indeed, so much of the West Wing gossip that Wolff recounts has been circulating in one form or another in DC for months that it, too, often felt more like a retelling of a long familiar story than a true scoop.Nevertheless, Fire and Fury is very much worth a readâ€”in part, to be sure, because it's the conversation topic of the moment in political circles, but primarily because it serves as both an excellent summary of the first year of Trump's presidency and as an ominous warning of the drama that will surely follow in the months ahead.",January-15-2018,4
4535,Great read.,January-31-2018,5
4536,"Wow, this book is amusing funny and wonderfully scary! It is surprising that these are the real people that are making major global decisions for the American people. As a person who follows the ""real news"", much of what is described in the book is the same as the reporting during the similar time.

4552,"A review of Fire And FuryMy initial feeling, from reading the excerpts before Fire And Fury was actually published, was that this was a Hunter S. Thompson, Fear And Loathing On The Campaign Trail style book. Now, having bought and read the ebook version of Fire And Fury, I have to add to that. It DOES cover the 2016 campaign, like Thompsons book covered the 1972 campaign, but it does more. It also covers the first 8 months or so of 2017, exposing in detail the complete unstructured chaos of the Trump White House. As such, I would compare it to Woodward And Bernstein's All The President's Men.Wolff, as has been noted, had access to the major and minor players over an extended period of time. I don't know for sure that all the quotations are accurate, since I wasn't there. Certainly the quotes seem to reflect the individual personalities accurately.I see nothing in this book that is unbelievable, aside from the fact that Trump won the election, itself the most unbelievable event in modern politics.If you are anti-Trump, this book merely connects the dots and fills in the details. If you are pro-Trump, you should read this, but I doubt you will.",January-11-2018,5

4554,"I found out about this book when our president claimed on Twitter that it was written by a ""total loser"" along with someone named Sloppy Steve, who cried and begged for his job when Trump fired him. It sounded intriguing, so I had to see what it was all about, so I bought the Audible version because - like the president - I don't like reading at all. I didn't want to spend the money really, because I get bored so easily when people are talking to me, but wow did this whole thing keep my attention!***SPOILERS***I'm not sure why Trump keep mentioning this book so often because just about everyone in it - from his advisers to his closest friends - basically spend the whole book saying what an idiot he is and how incompetent he and everyone around him is. I mean, even his daughter is making fun of him in this book. Why would he keep mentioning it?Anyway, this is probably one of the greatest stories ever written. At least I think it is. As I said, I don't like to read. But I couldn't stop listening to this it was so intense! I hope Sloppy Steve is OK, and I hope Trump isn't too mad at his friends and family. I hope he doesn't retreat to his locked bedroom with too many cheeseburgers and get sick watching stories about him on his three TV's.If you don't like reading and you are easily bored listening to people, I still highly recommend this book - or actually, just the audio because it's so easy to follow and to listen to.",January-6-2018,5

4588,"This must have been a difficult book to write. There is so much story to be told and the principle threads so entangled that it must have been very difficult to tie them together in a coherent story. Wolff mostly succeeds, but not entirely. Then again that is an important part of the very story Wolff is trying to tell, the story itself is about an incoherent presidential administration.Told in broadly chronological order of the presidential election of 2016 and the roughly first 200 days of the administration up to the middle of August 2017. At the end an epilogue focused on Steve Bannon, who has a claim to being the book's main character, brings the story up to roughly October 2017, but the pace of news has hardly stopped there. As I write this in January 2018 I can only be sure that much more will happen. Within its chronology, there are frequent steps backwards as Wolff brings in the various characters and their varying alliances coloring-in their relation to the then forward moving part of the story. Of all the characters brought to the fore, at least among the dozen or more who are in direct proximity to the president by living or working in the West Wing, only a single pair (Ivanka and husband Jared Kushner) keep the same relationship relative to one another throughout. Every other person or cabal-like group changes relationships often multiple times as most of the individuals involved come into the story and then go out!I do have one philosophical matter to bring up. Let's grant that Wolff reported accurately on everything he was told by everybody. He presents a fair picture of that to which he was a party either first, or at most second (and occasionally third) hand. At the same time that which he is reporting is, he points out, the back stabbing testimony of each cabal out to paint the others in the worst light possible. Even if those to whom he spoke were not outright lying to him, at the least they were telling highly selective truths almost surely leaving much out. Our only hope in this mess is that from the back stabbing of all sides towards one another and the occasional more neutral voice (though nobody was entirely neutral) from the periphery, Wolff has put together if not a true portrait, then at least a portrait true to the Kafka-esque nature of the administration! If that is a horrible thought, it is what makes this an important book.This is high class journalism first and foremost, but it reads at the same time like an Elmore Leonard novel! As Sean Spicer began to say ""you can't make this s*** up!"". Frankly this book would be hysterically funny if it was not so downright dangerous and disturbing.",January-15-2018,5

The president's mental instability, lack of self control, his juvenile antics and behavior, are all on display to the world every day. The man is an embarrassment, and should never have been elected dog catcher, let alone president. Worthy of note too, is that none of the people interviewed by the author, has disputed what was ascribed to them in the book. The fact that Wolff has hundreds of hours of tape, suggests that those interviewed, know that if they claim they never said certain things, Wolff can easily prove otherwise.",January-6-2018,5

The shocking, frightening truth about the Trump administration that the GOP, Fox and Trump supporters desperately want to keep hidden.The most important point of this book (in my opinion) is: Trump is being enabled and propped up by the GOP; our anger and outrage should be directed at them first.The crimes and scandals of the Trump administration will be taught in classrooms for decades to come.  And I look forward to the documentaries, movies, and television series about this stain in our history.",January-5-2018,5

4604,"What you get here is a book written from someone who was sitting in the White House and observing the action.  From that point you get an idea of the chaos that is going on there.  But if you'll just read and follow the news that same sense of chaos is evident.  Yes, it's first person picture but not as deeply insightful as all the brouhaha would lead you to believe.",February-20-2018,2
4605,"Poorly edited and redundant to a Trumpian point but a good gossipy book that ended months before it came out and in this fast moving age, that was most unsatisfying.

4615,"I rated this audiobook as five stars because of its obvious importance, not because of its entertainment value. I found it tedious to listen to, probably because of the banality and sordidness of the events it records. In that respect, I found this account reminiscent of accounts of life in the upper eschelons of the Third Reich. Anyone who has listened to Trump lo these many months should not be surprised or alarmed that his intimates describe him as semi-literate. The incoherence of Trump's speeches and tweets evidence a lack of the mental rigor imposed by regular exposure to the written word.  What I did find disturbing is the observation of some that Trump has difficulty associating cause and effect. Does this account for his disbelief in climate change? What does such a difficulty portend for his approach to  the Korean problem? Nuclear deterrence theory requires, if nothing else, an appreciation of cause and effect.

4662,"I was hoping for full interviews and first-hand witness accounts, anonymous or otherwise, of the behind-the-scenes action that took place during the campaign and just after at the start of the presidency. Sure, I was eager for a book trashing Trump, but I was also legitimately curious to get a glimpse at his inner circle when the cameras were off and get a feel what the tone was like as it was happening leading up to election night.Instead, the book starts on election night, and had a very fly-on-the-wall, detached feel to it, and was heavy-handed on speculation. Most of the fun, juicy tidbits were brought to light on the talk shows before the book was even released, so there weren't many surprises. It was a tedious, boring slog which read more like a school textbook than an entertaining read. I didn't leave it feeling satisfied, entertained or enlightened. I'd skip it.",March-3-2018,2

OK Michael, we know you have a tremendous vocabulary.  I'm sorry it interferes with your message.  At least you know the Trump loyalists haven't read it.  They would never understand it.

What the staff call the main loafer behind his back. What the orange man does with his time. It is quite interesting. There are grammar mistakes... didn't expect that. Knocked a star off for that.

Anyway, as far as the book goes it is really well written, in my humble opinion. I knew it was a good read when I came across Wolff's description of Bannon. I felt that with that description a criminal sketch artist would draw a meticulously accurate portrait of Bannon.

That said, Wolff's use of 50cent words when more common ones would have been more clear was annoying. I am well-educated and understood his meaning but it seemed to me that it was done to show his intellectual superiority versus the people he was writing about. I almost stopped reading when I encountered ""defenestation"". Come on Mike, use plain words to communicate. Also, does his publisher not employ any editors? A simple read through could have corrected any number of subject/verb errors and as well as basic grammar mistakes.

4723,"5 stars because of Wolt's truthfulness.  However, Hillary Clinton's book was much better.  Her's was very inspiring.  Read that for some honest reflection.  Wolf's book, although no fault of his own, is like reading a book about the Beverly Hillbillies or the Munsters.  In Donald Trump's words -- SAD!",January-21-2018,5
4724,"Wolff's no holds barred, I'll tell you the real truthbook is a worthwhile read.  I don't know if there isa bit of invention here, but it all connects withwell documented shenanigans we've heard in mainstream media.Despite some reviewer's notes to the contrary,there are indeed new revelations here.  I'll let youread to find them.  Some shockers!  And theinsider tone, with conversations reconsructed indetail makes for an easy read.  I'll refrain from saying ""fun,""though in fact, on some level, the book is a kind of dangerousfun.  If this were a novel, I would say it was a fun read.Sadly, it is not fiction.I must say, that Wolff is certainly a self promoter throughout,perhaps in the style of the book's outlandish character,Mr. Bannon himself.  Wolff purports to fairly refereeliberal and conservative, tea partyite and socialist opinions.In my opinion, he does in fact do a fair job.But do make a note of this: the author wants to be thefinal arbiter of truth on the story of the first 200days of Trumpworld.

Mr. Wolff is clearly not a fan of Drumph and so therefore I am sure there is some messaging and exaggeration yet it basically rings legitimate.

There werenâ€™t any bombshell revelations. However it is abundantly clear that the Mooch was right when he said Bannon euphemistically ""liked to smell his own farts"". This book also confirms my biases about Trump: heâ€™s a dotty old racist who is the living embodiment of President Camacho from Idiocracy - doesnâ€™t know, doesnâ€™t care to know, and canâ€™t be taught.",January-14-2018,4

Wallowing in this world is nauseating in the extreme which is one of the flaws.  All of this cast of unsavory characters is enough to make one despair not only for the human race, but also the poor political satirists who now find them displaced from their chosen profession.There is one story which my friends and I found puzzling.  Trump is apparently afraid of his domestic servants.  We were not sure if the reason he is afraid of them is because of his racism or classism?",April-2-2018,2

4841,"I did not like this book  and in  the same way that I won't read books about torture or animal cruelty, I wanted to stop reading it.  I found the behaviour of Donald Trump so distasteful.  Michael Wolff seemed to have a sort of glee in reporting this that I find disturbing.  I was tempted to stop reading because I try to avoid listening to tales when the teller  is enjoying telling on someone. I persisted because Wolff did help me look at the whole long year  His reporting gives a picture  one gets when pulling back from a microscopic view of a germ to a telescopic view of the results.  Not a pretty picture, but necessary. I'm giving it 4 stars because I think it is a review of what has happened to the United States in 2017.My hope is that those who really need to know and need help understanding these events will actually read it.  I'm a university educated senior.  I know how to use the dictionary function on my Kindle.  I have enough experience to appreciate the memes and idioms.  I also know many people who will be turned off by these difficulties and I fear that they are also uneasy about spending money on non-fiction books.  I guess I'm one of the elite Liberals.  I'm likely like most of the audience Mr. Wolff was addressing.  Preaching to the choir is easy.  Someone has to figure out how to get this very important information to those who don't read books like this.Because, the elections in 2018 are only months away.  That is when effective legislators need to be placed in Congress to slow down this run-away train.  The ones who can do that, elect the saviours  need to know who Trump and his supporters are.  Apparently they also are not likely to watch CNN or read actual newspapers, even on-line format.  How to reach them?  Surely there are tech  savvy  reporters who can use Twitter or Facebook or ....  Whoever you are, as you read Wolff's book, consider how to get this information to them.By the way, yes there are a few (less than 10 that I noticed) errors: a name misspelled, an article missed, not enough to interrupt the flow or impede comprehension.Now I'm going to soothe myself by rereading David McCullough's "" Truman""  because that was a man who did his bit to make America great .",January-6-2018,4

4844,"Loved, loved, loved this book. Full of juicy and gossipy details but on the other hand, I believe it is accurate. This guy had unprecedented access for whatever reason. He was just hanging out at the White House, listening and recording. You notice that almost no one is disputing him- probably because it's largely true and he will pull out the tapes to back it up. He even has direct quotes and gestures (making Bannon's contributions particularly entertaining). A fascinating look at the White House!

There is nothing surprising here, it just shines a brighter light on what many Americans have surmised from Trump's tweets and speeches. Definitely worth the double purchase.

Giving  an experienced investigative writer like Wolf unfettered access for almost a year is at best a cautionary tale if not an act of self sabotage.  If even 50% of this is true (and unfortunately the percentage is much much higher) - we should all be deeply concerned.The book is well written and - although there is some discretionary license used by the author - I found it informative and an entertaining read.

4871,Seems totally plausible.  I just wonder how Wolff was privy to so much inside information?,January-17-2018,4
4872,Does give an understanding on the why of the past years events.  If you like Trump then you probably will hate this book. If you hate Trump then this is the book for you. This book allows you an inside track on what actions Trump will take. Just remember that Trump is a zero sum guy.  There is no win-win only a win-lose when bargaining with him. If you gain anything then that means he must have lost something to his way of thinking. Watch out for any promises he makes as keeping his word is not his style.,January-21-2018,4

4874,Interesting book that contains very little new information; however id does give perspective to the events surrounding the election of Donald Trump.,April-1-2018,5
4875,It does an awesome job of explaining the perpetually burning dumpster fire that is the Trump Presidency. Even if you only believe 10% of what is printed in the book you should be very afraid.,March-19-2018,4
4876,Good laugh!,February-11-2018,5
4877,It's amazing! And it just confirms what we already know; Trump is a sociopath and EVERYONE around him is either a crook or a criminal.,March-16-2018,5

4879,What a piece.,March-23-2018,5
4880,Not as salacious as the news made it out to be but nevertheless an alarming window into the trump presidency,April-2-2018,5
4881,"It was good to get a little more context to what I was reading and seeing in the news over the past year, but still, it read a little gossipy.  I liked it, and I bought it because President Trump seemed VERY adamant about condemning it.  Seems like it was hitting a little too close to home.  Now I see why.  If you are a Trump supporter, you're going to hate it, if you're a detractor, take this book with a grain of salt and remember to do your own research.",January-11-2018,4

4904,Great â€œpetit histoireâ€ù book. Hopefully in the right way,March-7-2018,4
4905,"I bought this largely to give the giant middle finger to the unhinged psycho in office.  If he wanted so badly to stop it's release, that tells me that as a concerned American citizen, I should absolutely be reading it.  His image is everything to him and I know this is making his blood boil, I wonder if that that much anger could lead to a heart attack when you are a geriatric person who has a penchant for fast food and diet soda too ... Hmmmmm",January-7-2018,5

4909,Confirmed what most of us suspected about the Trump administration.  Hard to put down!,January-10-2018,5
4910,This book flows along.  Easy reading but tough to realize what the disgruntled American voter did to our country.  The Trump voter swallowed this line of malarkey and voted this mess into our lives. I must admit I enjoyed the look into this train wreck of an American president.,January-14-2018,5
4911,"I ordered my copy of this book immediately after it was publicized as a tell all about the Trump white house. Then I saw interviews with the author and felt less than confident that it would live up to the hype.I will say up front I am as Never Trump as they come, but, even with that bias, I found this to be a dry read focused primarily on Trump, Bannon and the Kushner duo that haters came to refer to as JarVanka.There is zilch about the odd marriage between Trump and Melania other than, no surprise, she plays no role other than that of occasional arm candy. Nothing is said about females in power in general (but, then again, this is the administration of misogny) other than Diana Welch and how marginalized she ends up being.I either ravage a great book in one day or, in this case, take more like a month to get through it. I'm not far from being finished but was surprised to learn that Wolff alludes to Nikki Haley being Trump's latest perv target. Sorry, but that defies logic and is unnecessary to even put into print.So, you may learn something new if you read ""Fire and Fury"" but I pretty much already knew the horror story that is the Trump Presidency. This just makes it more specific and real than most of us want in one lifetime.",February-1-2018,3
4912,Interesting,March-7-2018,4
4913,Entertaining to say the least.,April-3-2018,5
4914,Great insight into the constant infighting between White House factions. This book clarifies why the Trump administration has been such a train wreck. The personal stories of behind the scenes action make it a fun and worthwhile read.,January-7-2018,5

4922,"Reading a narrative that steps you through events as they occurred makes you realize how bad the past year really has been for America -- how chaotic, corrupt, self-serving, and destabilizing. While there are flaws in the book -- Wolff's tortured vocabulary, minor errors -- the overall effect is edifying. The book is a fast read, and you get a visceral feeling for events and the in-fighting, as well as how the Administration prioritizes itself above the American people.

4925,"While some may argue the details may be embellished, so much of the narrative matches up with what we as the public saw on the outside that it gives this book enough truth to me.  Its biggest benefit was in putting together the events of the last few years in a way that makes (more) sense.  I have been in such shock by the nearly daily jarring,uncoventional events and characters that it has become a blurr.",January-7-2018,5

4928,"Every review of this book that is negative is either written to mock how trump feels or it's a hard core conservative Republican. It's a good book, being censored by the president makes it better for the author and it just makes it worse for trump(who is already so bad). So enjoy the read. Even if you are Republican it's always fun to know more about your bad decisions.",January-8-2018,5
4929,Very interesting read. Some meandering and hyperbole.  But a fascinating book none the less.,February-11-2018,5

4935,I liked the book.  I did not like the printâ€”ink very light in some places.,February-5-2018,3
4936,"Fire and Fury was interesting for many reasons. The significant insight for me were the relationships Jarvanka (Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump) had within the White House staff. if the author's reporting is accurate, then Jarvanka's presence on the staff is one of the worst mistakes the president has made. Those who are not Trump fans will enjoy the book and its gossipy nature and be even more alarmed as to the competency of Trump and his staff. I deduct one star from my rating because of the sloppy copy editing.",January-10-2018,4
4937,Enjoyable read if you don't care for Trump but not well written.,March-21-2018,4

Even if 25% of the book rings true, Wolff's revelations make visible a very troubled White House - far more damaged than expected.  In any event, this also was my way of giving the finger to the Cheeto in Chief in a bigly, tremendous way!!",January-5-2018,5

4951,"GREAT BOOK.  Sad to say, I believe every word.",March-5-2018,5
4952,"Finishing ""Fire and Fury"" on the first anniversary of Trump's inauguration gave me goosebumps as to how far we've fallen as a nation. Michael Wolff's book is a terrific recent history of the dysfunctional White House and the chaos that swarms around it.  Steve Bannon plays a central role, of course, but ""the kids"" and other assorted oddballs appear frequently. Then there are the generals who try to bring order to the place, with little success. This is a circus that only Barnum & Bailey could have ever dreamed about. Wolff's narrative is crisp and insightful...a wonderful read!",January-20-2018,5

4957,"It was information we all thought we knew, but in great detail. The different factions within the administration battling for power was interesting. The book definitely showed that Trump is not fit mentally to be president. All the players around him continue to let him function to serve their own power hungry ambitions.",January-7-2018,5
4958,"Hilarious and terrifying, very well-written. Grain of salt mentality going in, due to the authorâ€™s poor journalistic standards, but really - nothing within could rightly be called â€˜new news.â€™  Itâ€™s everything we already know, with a bunch of extra spicey salacious sauce, topped off with errors, sloppiness and a significant lack of sources.And I loved it.

4965,"VERY entertaining in a terrifying and nauseating way.  Obviously need to read any book like this with the same amount of skepticism as any non-fiction political profile but so much of what Trump has done has been in public and unashamed that there really isn't anything that surprising in here, but the background of his staggering/stumbling accidentally into the White House is really something to behold.  Grifter, amateurs and clowns are ""in charge"", and one can only hope this serves as an unfortunately historical fluke and not the direction we are now heading. The fact that this author was even given half the access he had tells you all you need to know about the Gong show we now find ourselves living in.",January-7-2018,5
4966,nice read...,February-11-2018,3
4967,"Fire and Fury is sometimes sloppy and inconsistent but overall a great read and certainly a mandatory one for anyone following the Trump administration.The sloppiness I found was that sometimes people's errors/lies are corrected in text and other times not.  For example at one point Bannon tried to discredit Rupert Murdoch saying he's not American.  I know that Murdoch is a naturalized US citizen (born in Australia) but the book never points that out.  At another point a negative story paints a picture of Trump walking the White House in a bathrobe yelling at the TV.  The President refutes a story saying he never owned a bathrobe.  I remember at the time reporters found many pictures of Trump in bathrobes, but Fire and Fury does not bring this up.  The book also repeats Trump's claim to have been on the cover of Time magazine more that anyone else, another statement that is completely untrue but not corrected.For a book that uses anonymous sources and calls for a lot of trust, this sort of sloppiness hurts my faith in the writer.  And of course there are the denials and refutations from many of the people quoted in the book and the factual errors found by other reporters.It's an entertaining read but take it with a grain of salt.  Wolff admits that his sources all had their own agenda and would leak or lie to hurt other factions, so don't trust everything written.",January-23-2018,4
4968,It seems that everything is playing out just as the book predicted.,March-7-2018,5
4969,"I purchased the audio book through Audible and this review includes my experience of the narrator as well, Holter Graham, as well as the book's author Michael Wolff.First, I am a self-described liberal who follows politics closely and keep informed about what is going on in Washington. So I am fully willing to admit I am interested in any book that ""exposes"" Trump and his White House. Having said that, I do believe that Michael Wolff is not what anyone would call a highly respected journalist and much of his material needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Still, the remarkable thing to me is how closely the information in this book seems to align with the reporting that has come out of the respected mainstream media, and I believe this is largely an accurate account. What I appreciated about the book was how it took all the bits and pieces leaked and created a coherent narrative that gives some context to all the chaos we have seen coming out of the White House.What I was really surprised about, was what an entertaining read it is. Both the writing style and the narrator make this book really flow and much of it is quite humorous. This lived up to the hype for me and I do recommend it--especially the audio book version.",January-10-2018,5
4970,Facinating glimpse inside the White House,March-12-2018,3
4971,"I felt it best to read this in its entirety AND know/understand why Trump was so against Fire and Fury and anyone knowing what went on inside the White House.  There were some slow parts in the middle of Wolff's book but the story and his background revelations proved all the news correct that had been published to date by our free press (and understanding that the leaking of information was coming directly from inside the Trump Administration).  Since Donald Trump has proven that he does NOT read anything, it is too bad the 45th president can only regard the truth as ""Fake News""!  In summary, Donald J Trump unfortunately proves that he should never have become President and just stuck with reality TV.",January-11-2018,5

4977,"Not a fan, just was curious",March-26-2018,3
4978,great read,March-28-2018,5
4979,"Wolff's account of the Trump white house is much more nuanced than I expected.  He puts flesh on the bones of what everyone already knows from reading the paper and, more importantly, he humanizes people (Trump, Kushner, Ivanka, Kellyann, Bannon etc.) with specific detail so the result is they are sympathetic characters.  Not necessarily LIKABLE characters, But they don't feel like space aliens to me anymore. I highly recommend this book to anyone (like me) who was shocked at the results of the election, shocked at the people Trump surrounded himself, shocked at his twittering tic etc. etc. In context, it all makes sense, thanks to Mr. Wolff's intelligence and clear writing style. He did a public service in writing this book.  I hope he makes a million bucks. P.S. The most brilliant part, but indicative of the chaos in the WH:  why didn't anyone throw him out?",January-16-2018,5

Sadly, as I have read, I have this sinking suspicion that this presidency has its fingers in many pies and maybe made a deal with the author or his publishing company for royalties for this book if he â€œblew upâ€ù at its release. Who knows With DJT- everything is a deal! The book supports what critics of Trump already know. There is nothing new in it. There is nothing in this book (so far) that will be a game changer on the subject. Donâ€™t get me wrong- itâ€™s really funny to hear these â€œpolitical strategistsâ€™ eat each other alive behind each otherâ€™s backs; but Trump supporters will still sycophanticly support him.... because he is what he is.

5038,"I am impressed, of course I bought the Kindle edition and started to read right away. This Michael Wolf appears to be professional, nothing from what I read about Ailes or Bannon seems fantasy, to me reading it looked decent and real. If I were Donald Trump I would keep my mouth shut and STOP mentioning Bannon or this book, without his anger and desire to stop the selling of this book I would have NEVER EVER bought it. I am sure I will not be surprised reading it, I sensed all this from Trump's behavior and public events. He veered far right and behaves exactly like he is the head of his private corporation. I am not surprised Bannon left or got fired with the new direction Trump's Presidency went.",January-5-2018,5

Its just as addicting as many have described it. Its well written and engaging.

5048,"I bought the audiobook version of this book as my patriotic duty to stand up against oppression and defend the REAL America--not the current administration's warped version of it. The recording is almost 12 hours long. So far, I have listened to 2hrs 15 mins of it. The narration is superb. It feels like the reader is either talking to you or that he is having a conversation with someone and you are in the middle of it, taking it all in. It was hard to stop. But, I do have a life, so I bookmarked where I left off and I'll pick up another couple of hours tomorrow and so on until I finish it. Even if portions of it aren't exactly accurate, most of it does ring true and lines up with the developments that I have been following up from credible sources on the news since 45 was a candidate. Just to think of the massive WH cover-up of this man's mental health issues is alarming. All of these enablers that sit on the sidelines putting party over country are just as guilty of treason to our nation as the corrupt first family is. We are under attack from the inside. Our democracy and our way of life are in jeopardy. I surely hope that this experience teaches America a real lesson and that we become more vigilant and more conscientious at the ballot box in the future. Elections, good or bad, have consequences. We must get it right next time. Our very existence depends on it!",January-5-2018,5
5049,Decent but not really surprising. The author seems to be more focused on showing off his large vocabulary and over explaining things than actually telling what happened.,March-13-2018,3

5051,Outstanding view of the inner-workings of the trump presidency.,January-9-2018,5
5052,"Like most books written based upon gossip, I was disappointed.  The main parts of the book were published by the media so you really didn't learn much new about the book.Trump - didn't actually think he would win the election.  He was using his campaign to further elevate his brandIvanka - she was the one who first hired Hope Hicks to model some of her clothing line or work for her companiesJared - he and Hope and some of the others met with Russian officials regarding the election and then lied and said it was about Russian adoptions (Note: Russian adoptions were banned by Russia to the US years ago; Jared and the Trumps would not have been able to change that decision)Jared's father - has his own criminal legal problemsTrump properties - many of them are funded from foreign banks and the money is kept in a Deutsche bank accountMelania and Trump - lived in different parts of their apartment in NY; Melania was assured by Trump that he would not win so she didn't have to worry about leaving her cush life of lunching everyday; Baron is the focus of her lifeAnd a whole bunch of other stuff...what was interesting is that Omarosa was not mentioned in the book at all.  WEIRD!",March-6-2018,3
5053,Absolutely fascinating !!!,February-4-2018,5
5054,"Logic and reason are not helpful when trying to figure out and work with a person who has no moral foundation or soul. This book follows a path we have all walked, but confirms and adds to our understanding of what we have been through. There is some comfort in knowing that any effort to figure out the president is wasted.",January-6-2018,5
5055,"It's disheartening and frightening  to realize infighting, office politics, and self destructive behavior goes on in the most important office in our nation. The stakes are high and affect all of us no matter one's ideology. This tragedy is bigger than politics; it is putting our nation at risk. As some reviewers have mentioned, even if only a small percentage is 100% accurate, we are in trouble. It is time to step out of our ideological bubble and stand together to save this amazing country.  This is a pivotal time in history; let's show the world how America's citizens unite as one to fight for our freedom and how we take care of each other when our back is up against the wall - remember 9/11?  Remember the sense of unity? Remember how it felt to be united with each other?  Don't let politics tear what makes us unique apart.  Those of us not members of the ""Billionaire's Club"" mentioned in this book, want the same thing yet we are manipulated into fighting each other so they can continue being the ""masters of the universe.""I highly recommend this book not for it's palace intrigue, but for reflection on what we want for our country and how we chose leadership to maintain our American ideals.  I am encouraged to read reviews stating people are buying this book out of principle; censorship has no place in our country.  No matter one's politics, this ideal puts us on the same page.  Let it be the first step in our nation's healing.",January-7-2018,5

5087,"If you think about it, Michael Wolff, as a journalist for â€œThe Hollywood Reporterâ€ù, is the perfect person to research and analyze the Trump administration.  Trump, his family, and his associates are really the kind of collection of narcissists, fragile egos, sycophants, and rather dumb public personalities that inhabit the lower rungs of the show business and trash media world.  Wolff is both a keen observer of this world and knows how to interview and dig at these people to get at the heart of what makes them tick.Wolff presents a uniquely American tragedy - a man who really didnâ€™t expect or want to be President, his dismayed family, and a circle of hangers-on that signed up for something they didnâ€™t really believe in.  Thereâ€™s the expected back-stabbing and self-serving drama, but Wolff places it in the larger context of the public policy implications of their actions.As a â€œfly on the wallâ€ù, he understands, more than anyone else, that this isnâ€™t the story of a Presidential administration.  Itâ€™s a tv reality show filled with d-listers being played out at public expense.Trump detractors already have a general sense and broad outlines of whatâ€™s gone wrong with the administration.  With Wolffâ€™s book, they can start to get a sense of why and how the past few months have played out on the public stage as it has.  The book clues us into the personal motivations by all the individuals involved that have created the news stories and public image weâ€™re all more familiar with.  What will be most surprising to these readers is that the players are far more cynical, out of touch, and lacking in self awareness and basic competence than anyone ever thought.With Nixon, we had to wait a few years after his administration had ended in resignation to get a book like this that exposed how disturbed, paranoid, and dysfunctional the man was â€œbehind the scenesâ€ù during Watergate in books like â€œFinal Daysâ€ù.  With Wolffâ€™s access to the White House, with Trumpâ€™s personal nod, and the hundreds of interviews from the band of misfits at the heart of the storm, the train wreck is all here, laid bare for anyone with eyes to see.  Itâ€™s raw, revealing, and jaw-dropping.Wolffâ€™s book is a cautionary tale for anyone interested in democracy about the fundamental character of who we elect to office - their motivations, the kind of people they surround themselves with, and their fitness and ability to govern or serve.  It will no doubt be the first of many books that tries to make sense of the Trump years, but Wolffâ€™s account has carved a space in the political dialogue about the trend towards ideologues, hucksters, and celebrities as political figures and style with no substance in governance.",January-6-2018,5
5088,One of the best books ever written. Pity this is not fiction. Hope America can get rid of the Orange Flavoured Jobby soon!,March-7-2018,5

5092,Awesome page turner,March-18-2018,5
5093,"This book about the behind the scenes goings-on during the Trump campaign and first several months in Office is a fascinating read, and it reads as basically true. Are there a few places where Wolff takes some artistic license or is a bit off on certain facts? Iâ€™m sure the answer is yes, but criticism coming from a President who lies outright on an almost daily basis canâ€™t change the basic fact that the book absolutely nails the attitudes of the players. The most important revelation is something of which Iâ€™ve long been convinced: no one on the Trump team ever thought heâ€™d be elected. The outcome of the election was a publicity stunt gone horribly wrong and landed a passel of completely unprepared, largely unqualified people in the White House. Given that start itâ€™s no wonder that weâ€™ve seen the shameful and embarrassing disaster that has taken place over the last year.",January-14-2018,5
5094,"However much you think you know about Trump, his collaborators, his family and anyone else along for the ride on this insane roller coaster of an administration, there are stories in this book you probably havenâ€™t heard yet, or at least not in as much detail as you will here.  Trump himself tried to derail its publication, need I say more?  Harrowing, hilarious and an utter wipeout of not just Trump but the Republican Party which enabled and in a very real sense created him.",January-7-2018,5

5100,"Amazing book with lots of great examples. Trump is clearly mentally impaired, judgmentally unfit, incompetent, and possibly also illiterate. This guy is the reason that humanity probably won't survive for 1000 years, or 10. In a way, he is proof of the fermi paradox.At this point, we (California, New York, Oregon, Washington) should separate from the states that vote for him and let them have their own country. I don't see another way out of our situation.",January-7-2018,5
5101,I really enjoyed this book. I usually read fiction but this wasas fast paced as any fiction. It was also very scary to knoweverything Iâ€™ve though about Trump is true.

I am at page 227 and so far I see it as a waste of my money!If you don't know anything about trump you may like it, but if you do! there is nothing new in there! except his relationship with Melania  that is also visible on TV if you watch her reaction to his touch!So this is my view!",January-28-2018,3

5126,"Journalist Michael Wolff provides irrefutable evidence of what we knew all along, that Donald Trump has mastered his posturing as the President of the United States, but that he is a man completely out of his depth when it comes to the true responsibilities of the job. Many of us have assumed this to be true, but Wolff's interviews show how Trump knows how to control his own narrative and how this preternatural gift allowed him to be elected over someone whose integrity has been a constant source of irreconcilable argument. How far his vanity will go is anybody's guess as he is surrounded by sycophants and turncoats that amount to a revolving door staff. Wolff shows how that loyalty is precarious at best within the Trump White House, and if Steve Bannon is the first to jump ship, he surely won't be the last. The emperor not only has no clothes, he just doesn't care about anything but his self-vaunted image.",January-5-2018,5
5127,"I could read this chapter over and over again. Bannonâ€™s assessment of the Trump disaster is brilliant. Itâ€™s the most clear and concise breakdown what what is so wrong with Trump and the family. Time will tell if he is right. Iâ€™m not a Bannon fan by any means, I think he is dangerous. But this is a tour de force.",January-7-2018,5

5129,Unbelievably great!!! A real page turner.,February-4-2018,5
5130,"If even HALF of what is written within the pages of this book are true, it would be worth the cost of purchase.It all makes sense now, those things that left us scratching our heads last year. Why on earth would a rich guy, already famous for the past four full decades, want to run for the Presidency? Trump is clearly not remotely familiar with how things work, politically, and (face it) the White House is a dump compared with Trump Tower.Turns out, he really never expected, nor made serious plans, to win the election. When it happened, he and everyone around him were stunned. What do you we do now?  Well, if you are Trump, you are a winner! You play that hand, keep family close (even if they are dysfunctional) and do whatever you want to do.Of course, there are those boring daily briefings which, for someone with the attention span of a someone sixty-five years younger (do the math!), are pure torture.  So his staff keep it real simple: bullet points...and with a lot of Donald J. Trump within each simplified point. Never one for details, he lets things just happen, allows whoever is his favorite minion-of-the-week do whatever needs to be done, and onward to the next great reveal, the next episode.We probably all suspected this was happening, but Wolff provides the timeline and the behind-the-scenes detail and drama. How did he gain access? Very simple. Nobody was really watching, absorbed in the daily wild and crazy soap opera drama around them. He took a non-denial as a tacit approval and no one stopped him.  After all, Trump is Mr. Reality Television. Publicity is good. Whatever. Roll with it.I was riveted from the minute I started listening to the audio book.",January-6-2018,5

5134,"I bought this book because of Trumpâ€™s efforts to keep it from the public eye.There is nothing particularly shocking, if youâ€™ve been following the news. It simply fills in the gaps of what many of us suspected was happening in Washington.What surprises me is how many people are enthusiastic about this book after reading it. Iâ€™ve never read an author who was more in need of a good editor. At some point in Michael Wolffâ€™s Life, someone must have told him that he will get paid per run on sentence. His writing is so tedious it is a struggle to read. I got so bogged down I started counting the commas in his sentences. The unscientific average is 7 commas per sentence.

5138,"The most embarrassing parts of Fire and Fury are not the snarky gossip but the transcripts of the U.S. President's actual remarks. Wolff helps us understand the chaotic environment behind these bizarre pronouncements.Wolff reports a White House as divided as the U.S. Congress, with tea party Bannonites on one side, Jarvanka neocons on the other side, and the President bouncing randomly between.Michael Wolff has great advantages in telling this story because he can write well (few in the White House can), he's well-read (few in the White House are), he's well-connected to New York media outlets (he's a writer), and he's a welcome guest in Manhattan society salons.Wolff's biggest bombshell in ""Fire and Fury"" comes not from ""inside the Trump White House"" but from a dinner party at Steve Bannon's apartment in Arlington, Virginia, on July 20, 2017 -- source of the ""crack Don Jr. like an egg"" line and many other apparently tape-recorded zingers (pages 275-282).Other Highlights Include:p. 70 - Trump as Sun God.p. 58 - One paragraph connecting David Bossie, Steve Bannon, Andrew Breitbart, Robert Mercer, Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump!p. 186 - The email, supposedly from Gary Cohn, that begins, ""It's worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns."" And then gets personal!p. 250 - ""...this constant, daily, often more than once-a-day, pileup of events -- each one canceling out the one before -- is the true aberration and novelty at the heart of the Trump presidency."" -- Michael Wolffp. 256 - Did Jared Kushner leak the Trump Tower meeting email to skew the Russia investigation toward Don Jr. (a.k.a. ""Fredo"")?Bravo to Michael Wolff for being able to hit a moving target and keep it entertaining!Review Â©2018 by Steve O'Keefe, Executive Director, Staunton Media Lab.Page numbers correspond to the edition reviewed:""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,"" by Michael WolffPublished by Henry Holt & Co, 2018, Hardcover, ISBN 978-1250158062",January-23-2018,5

This may seem picky, but the book is getting a great deal of attention, not to mention selling out in bookstores.

Keystone cops, an apt analogue, stumble round the White House, and present there to promote their own interests, collaborate with Idiot Clown. Incompetence from stupidity and self-interest, described by Wolff on every page, always destroys all that is decent. Kelly and McMaster, two generals who were promoted beyond their capacity to perform, prove that our military long ago began promoting inferior intellects. The other general became CIA Director and immediately, like any small time crook, got caught with his mistress. While he destroyed careers of little people for keeping mistresses. McMaster had his minions write his thesis and later his dissertation. And I am halfway through the book.

The movie rights for this book will probably be astronomically expensive.It is not a particularly well written book.  But I could not stop listening to it.  The chapter about The Mooch's brief tenure, and Bannon's reaction to it, is laugh out loud funny.It is a very disturbing story.

That would be Trumpâ€™s most ardent supporters among the electorate that wouldnâ€™t care if he â€œshot someone on 5th Avenueâ€ù.If you didnâ€™t like Trump already, this is a good read. It gives you behind the scenes nuance to the events you followed already in his first year, it can be shocking, horrifying, but it isnâ€™t terrible surprising. You knew things were THIS bad already.If you like Trump? Well, youâ€™d never read this, and certainly wouldnâ€™t accept it if you did. Trump was as dumb as you were told all along, but you didnâ€™t believe it then, and you wonâ€™t believe it now, because that would be admitting you made a grievous mistake.My thought is to challenge all elected federal representatives to read it, and refute or defend what is written inside.

5192,"For the past year I have felt as though I have been trapped in a Mel Brooks movie gone horribly wrong.  Not so very long ago, the very notion of Donald Trump as President of the United States would have been seen as beyond absurd and a great topic for comic relief.  Of course, in real-life it is not so funny as his unparalleled ignorance has real-life consequences.Along comes Mike Wolff & the present ""tell-all"" book of what has gone on behind the scenes in the Whitehouse over the past yr.  Perhaps the single most startling thing about the book is that nothing within its pages is particularly startling to any objective person who has truly been paying attention to what has been going on since January 2017.  That is to say, the dumpster fire known as the Trump administration is as chaotic & disorganized on the inside as it appears to be on the outside.Nevertheless, the book certainly has its utility as it penetrates behind the faÃ§ade of the Whitehouse.  While Steve Bannon is quite an odious character, he nonetheless seems to be the one person in the entire Trump cabinet who is endowed with a modicum of common sense.  He tried to talk POTUS out of firing his F.B.I. director & sundry other bad decisions only to be overruled.  Coincidentally, ostensibly Bannon is also the only cabinet member who has ever bothered to pick up a book.Some hard-line Right wingers will cry foul as there are a few minor factual errors in the book in regards to dates / times / places.  Fair enough.  However, there is no reason to reject the gist of the book as much of what has already been written has been corroborated.  It is no secret that Trump is impulsive, has a short attention span, is a control freak and has to be babysat more than any other President in history.  Nor is this a Left wing conspiracy as Senator Jeff Flake has compared Trump to Stalin and Senator Bob Corker described the Whitehouse as an ""adult daycare.""  Flake & Corker are both Republicans who ""tell it like it is"" (well, most of the time anyway).Beyond that it is with quite a degree of audacity that people who would call out the present book for errors would @ the same time overlook huge outright lies from Trump in regards to crowd size @ his inauguration, millions if illegals voting for Hillary & his being wiretapped by Obama.  This stuff is straight out ofÂ 1984 (Signet Classics)Â folks!!It will be interesting to read a retrospective on the Trump as President fiasco, regardless of how things turn out.  While it appears that the administration will face the same fate as the HINDENBURG, I suppose only time will tell.  In the meantime, this is a great inside-look at the ""island of misfit toys"" running the executive branch of our government.  Some of this book is quite funny, but in a macabre sort of way;  just keep that in mind if you choose to read it.",January-17-2018,5
5193,"This very engaging book may not be a work of classic journalism and detail, but the over all story is supported by what we already know - and what Trump unwittingly reinforces virtually every day through observable behaviors that perfectly mirror the behaviors described in the book.  And ask yourself this: If the book is ""fake"" as Trump says, why the rage at Bannon? Isn't Bannon also a victim?  Trump must not think so, since he clearly believes the authors attributions to Bannon.  The book sheds a lot of light on the internal rivalries within Trump' s orbit. And it makes a very credible case that those who fear and/or loath Trump most are those closest to him and who toil to create the illusion of normalcy and decency around a President who is neither normal nor decent. These are perilous times and I believe this books sheds needed light on the dark forces now at the center of our government.",January-15-2018,5

He's just an arrogant narcissist w/no moral compass whose emotional growth has stopped somewhere around the age of 12. I know that's according to the author. But, as Sean Spicer said, ""you can't make this stuff up"". Mr. Wolff did a great job of putting everything in chronological order from the campaign until recently. That was very helpful for me, as things happened so fast in the past 18 months that my old brain found it confusing. I feel so embarrassed to be an American almost every time he opens his mouth or tweets. To make things worse, I'm a former Queens girl, 4 years older than Trump, & grew up just a few miles away from where he grew up. We were also born under the same sign. Kinda scary.

5216,"I bought the book yesterday and am more than half way through it.  Itâ€™s an extremely insightful read and a lucid window into the donaldâ€™s head space and entourage.  The negative reviews claiming that it is poorly written, has grammatical and punctuation errors are a lame attempt to discredit its veracity.  As a linguist, writer and grammarian, I can attest to the fact that it is well-writtenâ€”both from a mechanical standpoint as well as that of the syntactical.  Those reviewers attempting to paint the authorâ€™s writing skills in such a glaringly negative light evidently have no understanding of what quotations or direct quotes are.  This runs parallel to their cries that the media spews â€œfake newsâ€ù simply when it reports something unsavory which this administration and their ilk have actually said.Props to both Wolff and Bannonâ€”the latter to whom I never, in my wildest dreams, thought Iâ€™d ever express such sentimentsâ€”for sharing their stories.  This is truly a must-read and a defining moment of this surreal abduction of the highest office in our land.  It is a fascinating glimpse into the wizard behind the curtain, and it provides hope for logical individuals that there is a light at the end of this seemingly bleak tunnel.Buy it; read it; share it with friends, family, colleagues, and acquaintances.

Peace out!",January-6-2018,4
5221,"Goshâ€_where to start a review on Fire and Fury? First, a lot of people have criticized Michael Wolffâ€™s writing style. I agree with those people. His run-on sentences frequently forced me, by the time I reached the end of the sentence, to return to the beginning to help me understand what he was trying to say. Slowed me down. He also uses a lot of obscure words. There were typos. It appears to me that he wrote this book quickly so it could be published before the end of Trumpâ€™s first year in the White House. The content is, however, more important than the style.Friends, our country is in big, big trouble. I realize there are critics and Trump supporters who say that the situation at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue cannot be as bad as depicted in F & F. Yes it can be! I thought that President Obama was an amateur and, yes he was. The difference between Obama and Trump is that Obama surrounded himself with good, experienced people and then listened to them. Trump, in spite of his business experience, which is not as great as he makes it out to be, is clearly an amateur as far as managing a country is concerned and has hired a bunch of nincompoops and empire builders to help him screw things up. â€œJarvankaâ€ù as Wolff refers to Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, have no business in the West Wing, whispering in Trumpâ€™s ear. Steve Bannon, according to the book, was trying to set himself up in the White House to get his agenda in the forefront of â€œTrumpianâ€ù plans. That would be awful in the extreme. The parade of folks into and out of the West Wing has shown that nobody can please Trump for long and that there will be no stability in the Executive Branch of the government until Trump is gone, hopefully in three more years. That assumes we have not gotten into a nuclear war with N Korea before then and given Trump's lack of understanding of diplomacy and the ramifications of pushing his â€œbigger button,â€ù we may be in one before long. I was a bit surprised that N Korea was not mentioned more in the book.Throughout the book Trumpâ€™s intelligence is assaulted by the people closest to him. Certainly they know him better than I do and I have to take their word on that subject. Certainly some of the things he has said show arrogance as well as a lack of understanding about the most basic of things important to the country and the world.While some of what is in the book may be exaggerated or fabrications, IMHO the greater part is true. Certainly a lot of what Wolff writes about played out in the media over the last year. What Wolff provides is the background on how these events got out of the inner circle into the light of day. Scary, sad, really worrisome. It is quite easy to associate what is in the book with the first year history of the Trump administration and Trump himself. Interestingly, the book stops in October, with the departure of Steve Bannon from the White House. Reviewing the three months since then, it is hard to believe just how much other ridiculous stuff has happened. It never seems to stop. A new day, more faux pas and more cover-ups and outright lies.Read this book. You will be both glad you did and scared to death.",January-17-2018,4

5241,Itâ€™s everything I wanted to read about piâ€™s 45 and his nazi puppets,March-16-2018,5
5242,Great book!,January-10-2018,5
5243,$15 to protest censorship. Well worth every penny. 5 stars for the entertainment factor.,January-12-2018,5
5244,Well written and shocking if only half accurateIt will be very interesting to see how it all turns out,January-12-2018,4
5245,Very interesting information,March-8-2018,4
5246,I am mixed about the book.  On one hand I think it was written well.  On the other hand I am very angry that this is occurring in our government.,January-10-2018,5
5247,"It arrived very quickly, I read it in a few days, loved it......",February-28-2018,5
5248,"This book is not an intellect's read, but, then again, look at its subject. Bought kindle version.",January-6-2018,5
5249,"I read the book in one sitting. While I wondered if Trump is mentally unstable, this book absolutely confirms it for me.  Scary that this man is running the country. Elected officials are sitting along the sidelines watching the show.. Watch out..... VOTERS will payback in kind..",January-6-2018,5
5250,A very good read.,March-19-2018,4
5251,Seems to me that there is fire and fury inside the Trump White House everyday.,March-30-2018,3
5252,This is probably the most important book of the 21st century and will be used by historians and political theories until the end of civilization.,January-11-2018,5
5253,First I laughed and then I cried.  No real surprises here.  The crisis this country is in is more than Donald Trump & Steve Bannon.  It is all those in the government and the White House that allow this madness to continue for their own greed.  Would love to see a book that calls them all out by name.  The American people who voted for this man are the real insanity in this country.  I apologize to our forefathers for what we have done to their dream.,January-6-2018,5
5254,Confirms much of the info that has been emanating from the White House for the past year.,January-11-2018,5
5255,Itâ€™s a page turner!!!!,January-10-2018,5
5256,"As I read this book, in real-time were the predictable and validating repetitive, hyperbolic WH rebuttals as if popping off the pages of chapter for 1 in Fire and Fury 2. Back stories are as interesting as the cast of characters and scenarios playing out over the past year. This book reveals a three-ring circus of WH factions, all unskilled or unprepared for the lion taming, trapeze swinging and knife throwing in the circle wheel - and each throwing media leak bombs into each other's circle as the Barker holds the match to the (nuckear) cannon aimed at the spectators in awe and announcing the next surprise act of insanity. No different from what Trump depicts in live tweet and TV, Trump reminds us of Sarah Palin being asked Katie Curric's 'name one thing that you read?', along with his paranoia that he can see Russia tapping on his bedroom window to the beat of Mueller's drum. Even those without political interest will find this book worthy of a two-day binge.",January-11-2018,5
5257,Interesting read but not as shocking as everyone seems to think.,April-22-2018,4
5258,"Fire and Fury profiles a White House in chaos and a president with serious mental problems who has no attention span or capacity to listen, read, and learnâ€”a man who made four-year-old-bored-boy faces when briefed about the specifics of the Constitution or health care reform or any policy matter, a man who landed the most important job in the world without meaning to, a man whose main concerns are being liked, getting richer, and playing golf.I read the Kindle version, which like the hardback, was launched early in response to Trump's attempt to block publication. It is in severe need of proofreading. (My favorite typo: ""Bannon, with mounting ferocity and pubic (sic) venom . . ."") As an editor, I am annoyed, however the sloppiness does match its subjects, who have zero respect for care and the painstaking effort it takes to do something well. So there is a certain karmic justice and artistic symmetry to the current picture:(1) This blustery self-promoter with no scruples rides the free publicity of the media's fascination with his insanity, and he uses the coverage to stoke self-righteous rage and promises to use the loopholes and outright illegal tactics that made him wealthy to benefit the little guys, so they vote for him.(2) Once in office, his lack of knowledge of, let alone care about, the law as well as his self-involved rage and inability to understand anything other than winning/losing or praise/criticism throw the White House and the world into chaos.(3) A well-known ""slasher"" writer uses the open access granted him by an administration who loves attention and has no understanding of who the writer is (because vetting is not their style), not to mention the difference between on and off the record, and he hangs out, amiably observing and making nice, then succeeds in weaving his observations into an addictive storyâ€”an almost impossible-to-accomplish narrative given the a level of insanity, chaos, and its myriad participantsâ€”and it all goes into a sloppily made book, rushed to publication to cash in on the free publicity of its subject trying to quash it . . . and hopefully it eventually does the job the Trump voters wanted: blowing up the swamp.",January-7-2018,4
5259,I support a free press and free speech.,January-5-2018,5
5260,Took me a while to get through it but it solidified my opinion of what the white house circus has become,March-16-2018,3
5261,"It was not a great read. Disjointed, no flow. Many chapters left you without conclusions.",April-14-2018,3
5262,Great content and soporific writing style. Put me to blissful sleep many times. THE book to buy to fibd out about this strange new president.,March-10-2018,5
5263,"Some of the women in Trumpworld are smart, but they don't last. Some of them are fluffers, and they do. Same with the men. Wolff spent NO time thinking about what he was saying here and neither did his editor, but if only a small percentage of this book is true, we have a moron for president.",February-2-2018,2
5264,"This book made some great points, it just makes them over and over again. It's a dull read, that could have been much shorter.",March-11-2018,3
5265,"Iâ€™m still chewing on the journalistic and literary implications of how Michael Wolff gathered and presented content for this book. There are some serious ethical and precision questions that deserve sober attention. That said, this is a gripping, damning and ultimately credible account of a White House in disarray, a type of disarray that should be concerning to all Americans. Interesting times lay ahead for the United States of America. Wherever the next chapters of our history take us, we canâ€™t say we werenâ€™t warned.",January-7-2018,5
5266,"It was interesting, a little like reading an Enquirer article.",May-3-2018,3
5267,"When the President of the United States seeks to ban a book, the most important action we can take is purchasing it and reading it. I bought the hardback, Kindle version, and audio as my personal response to a man who has so little respect for freedom of speech. Iâ€™ve just started the book, and it is enlightening. Under these circumstances, Iâ€™d still buy it even if it were totally boring and useless.",January-5-2018,5
5268,Interesting.  But he is  poor writer.,March-19-2018,4
5269,"Not much surprising for a political junky, but a good read nevertheless.",March-7-2018,4
5270,"Itâ€™s a good read, though full of errors and much needed editing. It details events in the Trump  White House that you thought were going on.  It shamefully outlines the rise of a man who has no business being president- he possesses no respect for the office and doesnâ€™t have the wherewithal to know what to do.",January-7-2018,4
5271,I got the kindle edition first thing in the morning. It made me cry for America. A childish person is the president of untied state. What a shame:(,January-5-2018,5
5272,"A good read. You can make up your own mind on the accuracy of the authors reporting. But, it does make one wonder about what really is going on in the Whitehouse. I think that everyone should read the book. It is worth your time.",January-12-2018,5
5273,Provides some interesting insight and backstory on the players in the White House.  Confirms your worst fears that the inmates are running the asylum.  Entertaining with good vocabulary but not an in depth look at any issues....which is a sign of the times.  Concludes that politics today is streaming entertainment and we watch the drama because surely it canâ€™t get any worse and then it gets worse..like watching a drama series on Amazon!,January-15-2018,4
5274,A lot of Infos but written in a mÃ©li-mÃ©lo way: hard to follow.,April-14-2018,2
5275,very poorly edited.  good content,March-13-2018,2
5276,It is a good book but a lil dry.  It was also mostly played out in the news before amazon delivered my book _Ÿ˜¢,March-14-2018,3
5277,Superb!!!,February-11-2018,5
5278,Good reading,March-7-2018,5
5279,A lot of so-called facts.,February-20-2018,5
5280,"The book content is scary. I believe most of what is in the book, as it matches what is on the news,",March-16-2018,4
5281,The beginning of the end of the national nightmare is all described in these pages.,March-7-2018,4
5282,Like potato chips you can't read just one page or one chapter- before you know it you have consumed the whole book,March-30-2018,5
5283,"Nothing new, except that is told in the funniest way imaginable - unadulterated truth!",April-17-2018,5
5284,"Fascinating insight into the mudslide of POTUS' mind....chilling, but hypnotising!",January-11-2018,5
5285,Now that we knew what inside the white house under Trump!!,March-26-2018,3
5286,Whether there may be some small discrepancies. The book is very credible and quite revealing of the state of Trump and the Whitehouse - scary,February-19-2018,5
5287,"Loved it. Best part,  it's all playing out.",March-7-2018,5
5288,"Despite being an avid reader of the daily White House dysfunction in the news, this book gives an up close portrait of the why and how it is so dysfunctional.",January-8-2018,5
5289,scary! but i'm sure quite true,March-7-2018,4
5290,Finally someone that is truthful,January-8-2018,5
5291,"As soon as it was available for pre-order, i ordered it. It couldn't come fast enough and with the build up, i was worried about a let down. Well, it wasn't a disappointment but a fabulous read. I didn't want to stop once i began. As I read, i felt like I was that fly on the wall, listening in on conversations not meant for anyone else to hear. I also became acutely aware of my own naivete when it comes to politics, the darkness of it. The meetings, the interviews, the conversations ring truth. It's very personal, on every level. If twisted, it's not the interviewer but the person telling their side. It is not the author's opinion like some people are pushing. Not at all. It begins right before the presidential win and then the wild ride begins. I recommend  this book for those who are open minded, who wants to know what currently goes on in this admin and what they feel about the man in the oval office and those close to him.",January-8-2018,5
5292,"This is my first ever presidential tell-all book. I debated for a day or so before finally hitting the buy now. At present, I'm aboard Jet Blue, headed to Miami to hop on a cruise ship. I thought it would be beneficial for my emotional well being to turn off and un-wire from all the constant chatter coming from Trump and his cult, but noooooo...I'm going to devour the insanity of this book.  I can probably read most excerpts on social media, but it's worth every bit of the $14.99 I spent for the Kindle version simply because Donald Trump doesn't want me to read it. I'm a rebel, that way.",January-6-2018,5
5293,Amazing,February-4-2018,5
5294,Loved the book,January-10-2018,5
5295,"Same old noise. It may be true, but I had to put it away. Very sad and depressing.",February-21-2018,2
5296,liked the inside view of familiar characters.  not so much with unknown characters,March-24-2018,3
5297,Good start but I was ready to just finish it half way through.  Seems like it was all written from the point of Steve Bannon,March-17-2018,2
5298,I wish the jacket didn't have that picture on it. Terrible to look at all the time,February-16-2018,3
5299,"I did not appreciate the writers writing style.  Most of the stores I had heard on the news.  Other than that, it was good.",February-22-2018,3
5300,I especially liked the description of how he achieved that coiffure.,April-4-2018,4
5301,Worth the $15 to get this on the best seller list and piss off Donnie.,January-6-2018,5
5302,Book had more to do with Banon than Trump.,March-27-2018,2
5303,"Most of the book just reinforced what is already known in the public domain - a recount of the main events that have plagued the Trump administration; the erratic and unhinged behaviour of the president that makes it plain that he is unfit to be POTUS, and the revolving door of personnel.The only real insights were the extent to which the two factions would go to oust each other -Jarvanka (Jared and Ivanka Kushner) on the one hand and Bannon on the other. The extent to which poor decisions were made; the inability to anticipate cause and effect and short-term thinking was another notable feature.The inability of Trump to take personal responsibility rather than deny, justify, defend or blame others for everything was not really emphasised by the author.",January-13-2018,3
5304,Good description and analysis of everything and all the players,March-12-2018,5
5305,don't like Trump.,May-2-2018,3
5306,A seventh grade English teacher would shred this and its part of why itâ€™s so funny.  A book about a a clown.,March-27-2018,5
5307,I wish every Trump voter would be required to read this but they are too stubborn to even consider his flaws.,January-20-2018,5
5308,best is the data. worst is the fakery of invented conversations with speculation competing with history,March-11-2018,4
5309,Must read..... Trump exposed,March-29-2018,5
5310,"I'm only 50 pg.s into it, but it's already proving to be very enlightening.",January-12-2018,5
5311,Good read.,January-10-2018,5
5312,Some of the authors words were unknown to me which made the book hard reading.,March-28-2018,3
5313,Must read,January-8-2018,5
5314,"While somewhat believable and engaging, the author's interviews since publication cast subsequent doubt on his truth-telling since innuendo and coyness leave me wondering if he engages in same practices in writing that are a ploy to sell more books at the expense of total veracity.",January-31-2018,3
5315,"I bought this book first as a statement, as an informed, voting constituent, a member of the People of the United States of America, with the freedom to read without censorship.The executive summary or Preamble to our Constitution states: We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.James Madison wrote that the Constitution is derived from the superior power of the people.  America was to be a nation defined and formed by its people - not a monarch - not a dictator â€“ not bullying lawyers, and not self-serving politicians who incidentally donâ€™t have to worry about social security since we have set them up with lucrative benefits and retirement packages paid for by us â€“ their tax paying employers - the People of the United States, the people to whom they should be answerable.If this book and all the other reports and events surrounding this presidency and indeed the GOPâ€™s machinations and self-interest were a report on the status of a corporation for which the average manager had responsibility â€“ heads would role!We the People need to stand up, be informed, be heard and find responsible, accountable leadership for better choices in future elections â€“ to regain and preserve what was once the dignified, respected and progressive United States of America â€“ not the mockery and lie this administration has made of this country and democracy.Based on excerpts, the book will likely make me ill, and will require some skepticism for embellishment.  However, as the saying goes, Where there is smoke, there is fire!  It is a marker of where we are in this time.",January-5-2018,4
5316,A,February-4-2018,4
5317,Nothing presented that really was any surprise. Interesting insight into the kindergarden that the Whitehouse is - how it's run by people not working to better the country but to better their own position.,February-3-2018,4
5318,Initially buying this book because Trump tried to hide it.  Looking forward to confirming what I already know about this most-unpresidential president.,January-5-2018,5
5319,Not an easy book to read.,February-28-2018,3
5320,Great product and seller!,March-27-2018,5
5321,"Well written and easy to read book.  That is, it's easy to read because it's well written.  The subject matter is nothing short of stomach churning.  While there's no real way to determine if the book is accurate, it certainly has the ring of truth to it.  Good grief, we are in trouble.",January-6-2018,5
5322,"Print too large, content too vague, and many aspects totally pointless, bias and without factual evidence.  Makes a nice paper weight _Ÿ˜_",February-4-2018,3
5323,"Bought for a friend  who wanted it, so have no real opinion.",March-3-2018,3
5324,Great story about psychopaths - shows what's wrong with those at the top - billionaires without morals.,March-17-2018,5
5325,"Let me say this up front: I didn't vote for Trump, so I'm perhaps predisposed to enjoy the foibles of the ""winner."" But if even ten percent of this book is accurate, and this is how America is being managed... Well, I guess the Constitution provides for that scenario.",January-14-2018,4
5326,"None of us can really judge this book because none of us knows the truth.Overall it was written pretty well. Lots of gossip, fact and maybe a few lies. Who knows?We find ourselves in a situation, basically of our own making, where our politics, due to our patriarchal society, have reached the end of the fulcrum. The result is people like Trump. Disenfranchised groups, like his base. And the exposure of all that is wrong being flung in our faces. And there's plenty wrong.It's time to straighten it all out. Not an easy task, but very necessary.",January-11-2018,4
5327,"I guess the it's not the books fault, but for the life of me I can't believe that a president not elected by the popular vote and as ignorant and crooked as Trump is, a proven liar, and a flat out pig can be allowed to continue on without people jumping up and down to get him out!",January-18-2018,4
5328,Well written. Hard to tell fact from fiction.,March-7-2018,4
5329,This is a gory tell all of theâ€‹ Trump administration and how it colluded with Russia to sell the election out top Russia and how Jared and others used their connection to the Russin to get bribe money.,February-2-2018,5
5330,Letâ€™s not make America hate again! No reason to put the clan in the White House. Great book. I knew it was bad but not this bad.,January-21-2018,5
5331,A fun ride for sure. It certainly lines up with the history I watched unfold. Canâ€™t wait for the sequel!,February-7-2018,5
5332,"Every American should read this book.  I could not put it down.  Bannon whom I never agreed with, emerges as the smartest person in the White House. Jared pursues his own family interests thus getting rid of Comey.  It makes the White House resemble the menace of the Borgia papacy.",January-7-2018,5
5333,Fascinating even if unbelievable view of the chaotic TrumpWhite House. Explained many characters that influence our incompetent POTUS. Feels like a gossipy novel even if based on true events since many events & dialogue are unverifiable or not referenced.,January-13-2018,4
5334,"I found it easy to spot the more gossipy anecdotes, but hard to ignore the reality of much of Wolff's observations.",March-17-2018,4
5335,If even 10% of this is true Trump needs to be removed.  Members of Congress need to stop whispering behind doors and protect our country.,January-7-2018,5
5336,My husband is reading the book.  I have not opened it.  He said it is pretty enlightening.,February-4-2018,5
5337,Reasonably priced and fast delivery to my ipad,March-19-2018,5
5338,I have to wonder how Wolff got all this backstory and innuendo by simply camping out in the White House. He wraps it into a story that reads like fiction. Sadly it reminds you of all the disasters that this administration has induced in the first year.,January-14-2018,4
5339,I actually got bored reading since it is just like his every day actions from Day 1 !!,May-3-2018,3
5340,Great - everything that reveals Trump and his cohorts real selves makes me feel safer.,March-17-2018,5
5341,"Substantively, it's incisive. Stylistically, it's discursive & jumbled.",February-27-2018,5
5342,Good book,April-7-2018,5
5343,"So much bad press on the veracity of both the author and the contents. Still, much of it was really verified if you watch and read the news from all outlets. By that I mean ALL the news Outlets. Liked the book.",January-21-2018,3
5344,"Very interesting and eye opening, thank you for telling the American voters the truth about the lies that the Republicans are trying to shove down our throats.",January-18-2018,5
5345,author sounded pompous trying to insert big words to make his narative sound more important than it really was.,March-3-2018,2
5346,"Its a sobering piece. You want to laugh until you remember its all real. Many of these stories have leaked to the press already, but it is still worth reading for all the unfortunate nuance.",February-17-2018,5
5347,"Wolff is no liberal, and Fire and Fury is not particularly well written or analytic (the basic structure is chronological). Yet somehow this makes his portrayal of a White House in perpetual disarray all the more disturbing. The portrait of the president that emerges is that of a needy L'enfant terrible who never expected to win and is unable to attend to even the most basic tasks of governing for even a few minutes, but incapable of delegating even vital responsibilities to others in an organized way. Instead the President plays off one feuding faction against the other as if in some kind of reality tv show based on whim, deep insecurity, and the habitual need to always blame others when something goes wrong.The White House is seen as a scrum of feuding factions each less competent than the other. Jared and Ivanka, â€œJarvanka,â€ù are seen as the driving force behind firing Comey. Wolff sees Bannon as itching to infuriate moderates and liberals under a theory of change that radicalizing the left will drive the middle into his hands. Yet a more likely hypothesis is that he and Miller successfully burned and bridges to moderates before they could be built to isolate the President from more moderate elements within the White House and his own party. Indeed, Wolffâ€™s Trump seems like he would be just fine with a single payer health care system as long as Trump got the credit and the love and adoration that he perpetually craves.One is tempted to think that surely things canâ€™t get any worse â€“ until you remember that the president has his finger on the button. If even half of what Wolff wrote is true we are in deep, deep â€œstuff.â€ù",January-19-2018,3
5348,"The only thing more difficult to get through than this book is Trump's presidency. Wolff too often uses hyphens mid sentence to add commentary that often strikes you as rambling and makes the point challenging to discover. There are far too many spelling errors and sentences that just don't make sense at all. To the actual content of the book; many statements are preceded by a disqualifying statement, like ""She often thought, though perhaps she didn't"", or ""His view of Trump, though he never said so, was"".... Really?This book is just not worth your time.",January-10-2018,2
5349,Bought this as a gift for someone. She probably likes it.,March-29-2018,5
5350,It sheds light to the chaos that is happening in the  WH right now.,March-7-2018,4
5351,"Thought at first that this had to a work of fiction, and then to accept that it is real people acting in very unreal ways! You could not make this stuff up, it would not be believable and it is that!",January-27-2018,5
5352,Bought the kindle version. Perfect delivery this am. Still taking in the noise on tv but cannot wait for all the juicy details and cast of characters that arenâ€™t covered daily. Brilliant timing and bravo....,January-5-2018,5
5353,Not an easy read. I was bored.,April-2-2018,3
5354,"Trump and his cult members have ushered in one of the darkest times in this country's history. This book will be nothing new to those of us who have paid any attention over the last ~2 years, but it is a quick read and an excellent reminder of the need to stay vigilant, get active, and take back our country from one of the most despicable villains to ever threaten the core values and very concept of Democracy.",January-6-2018,5
5355,"I can't put this book down, I just keep flipping from page to page. The book is filled with quotes and paints a good picture of the Trump campaign and administration from someone on the inside.What I like:- Quotes- The fact that trump et. al. put a cease and desist order on it and claimed nobody would buy it- Kindle version is cheaper and you'll get the book instantaneously.What I dislike:- I do feel as though I've found one or two grammatical errors, but it does not detract from the overall experience.",January-5-2018,5
5356,Easy to read and follow. Only 1/3rd of way finished with book. Hooked and learning more and more. Book is not as critical of the President as some would lead you to believe. It does have some interesting facts and perspective. Kind of established for me why the President is still very surprised and mentions that he is president. I completely understand now.,January-6-2018,5
5357,Found to read!,March-13-2018,5
5358,"While I was less surprised at the dangerously dysfunctional nature of the current White House as depicted within, Mr. Wolff confirms what I suspected all along. It is little wonder this manbaby of a president sought to squash this book. Let him tweet his insults and continue his childish name calling. You read ""Fire And Fury,"" and decide for yourself.",January-21-2018,5

5360,Not what I expected too much and innuendo and hearsay.,February-23-2018,4
5361,To think that this man is the leader of our country right now is unbelievably disturbing!  How can so many have fallen for a man who doesnâ€™t read and bases his opinions off of what he sees on Fox News? â€œIdiocracyâ€ù comes to life!,January-22-2018,5
5362,This book confirm what we all knew..He is nuts..,January-13-2018,5
5363,Great. But scary,March-16-2018,5
5364,Iâ€™ll start by saying that Iâ€™ve currently read 25% of the book. Itâ€™s slow going as I highlight and make notes. I hope amend as I go. Iâ€™ve already had the most highlights of any book Iâ€™ve ever read.,January-5-2018,5
5365,"While it confirmed what we have known all along, the writing was not spectacular.",March-18-2018,3
5366,Still readk g the book...interesting so far,February-13-2018,4
5367,"Republicans will hate this book. Democrats will love it.

The events in it are all familiar to anyone who pays attention to the news, but the backstory of the rivalries, infighting and hapless WH strategy was illuminating; also, the roles of elusive figures like Hope Hicks and others were fleshed out.

5393,"If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. Easily the best read I've had in years. My lasting impression will be understanding Bannon, and what a cancer he was on Trumps white house. He single-handedly destroyed Trump's presidency. From starting a race war within Trump's cabinet, to bullishly plowing forward with no experience, knowledge or finesse, only arrogance and blind loyalty to his own unhinged ideology. Bannon, who sees governing as boiling down to winners and losers with no room for compromise. This man played the truest zero-sum game in modern times, whose t-shirt design would read ""party like it's 1933"". What a sickening point of view, thanks to Wolff for bringing it to the ""body politic"" carbunkles and all. And also a question, as asked by Brent Budowsky of The Hill. We know that Bannon had serious concerns regarding the infamous meeting between the Trumps and the Russians, in June, 2016. is it possible that Bannon went to the FBI with his concerns? Is Bannon our generation's Mark Felt? Long shot? Yes. Intriguing as all get out? Oh heck yeah!",January-7-2018,5

It's not the type of reading (gossip) that I care for much.  Curiosity got the best of me, and my oh my, what a fun read.  As someone who reads quite a bit of news, I was not hugely surprised by the content.  Trump's Whitehouse is being well covered by the press, or so this book would seem to point out.  What was new was the verifications of some of my most nightmarish ideas about Trump himself.  If our country survives into the decades ahead, if our civilization can address its relationship to energy production and pollution, Trump will be a complete laughingstock.  If we do not address these things, his madness will likely be seen as yet another volatile symptom of global warming.",January-15-2018,5

But overall I mostly laughed and was glad someone actually printed some of these events out.",January-22-2018,4
5400,"The Trump campaign strategy was based on ""The Producers"".  Bannon ruined everything and changed their campaign into a winning campaign. The result resembles John Mulaney's ""horse lose in a hospital"".  Trump will eventually crash and burn because of corrupt business practices that would have never come to light if he lost.  In sum a very entertaining read, worth every penny.  Thank you, Mr. Wolff, for your service.",January-5-2018,5

If that baboon in KKK robes hadn't raised such a stink about it, this would have been another Barnes and Noble Bargain Shelf book in six months. if my $15 is the only way to stick it to the chief sexual deviant, the adulterous misogynist, in the newly dubbed White Robe House, it is money well spent.",January-21-2018,5

5411,"I'm one third through the book.  The book gives a quite convincing explanation of who Donald Trump is, how he operates, and how those around him operate. It's extremely readable and interesting.  Michael Wolff is not a 100% reputable journalist.  He's previously been criticized for inaccuracies.  He appears to have spent a few months writing articles praising Trump and attacking the media as a way of getting access to Trump.  With that said, if had not done so, he wouldn't have received the access to write this book.  He quotes a number of people in the book.  Very few of them have later said that he misquoted them.  Steve Bannon, for instance, just recently said that he didn't intend to refer to Donald, Jr., in criticizing the meeting with the Russians.  It appears that the account is mainly accurate.  The people who have criticized it are mainly the people least likely to be believed.  I would not be surprised if this book establishes in people's mind the identity of the real Donald Trump.  The most reputable journalists will now attempt to confirm the accounts in it and the general substance of the outline he has portrayed.  Unfortunately, this book does not provide any information as to how to counter Trump.  It shows the Emperor with no clothes; however, it's always been obvious how much of a huckster Donald Trump is.",January-7-2018,5

5420,"If you are scouring the news everyday about the administration (like me!), this book is a must read. You will get a deeper accounting of events (and tweets) already reported. The descriptions of leaking culture were fascinating. Bannon is often heard from.The author says not all information presented has been verified, represents retellings of events as verbatim script, and his liberal use of loaded language makes it hard to tell his opinion from that of his sources. He allows sources to provide directly conflicting information, often without acknowledgement. I highly recommend the book, but the reader must keep a critical eye. In true Trumpian fashion, even the tell-all book begs more questions and leaves one confused when finished.",January-6-2018,4
5421,"Essentially the White House is full of chaos and infighting with different camps trying to win Trump over. As we have known, Trump knows very little, doesn't know he doesn't know, yet thinks he knows quite a bit. He can't be bothered to learn things.

Otherwise Trump wouldn't have excommunicated Bannon as soon as the book was published.And we know that Wolff had White House access for months.Personally, I wasn't going to buy this book until Trump tried to suppress it.

5428,"Most of what's in this book shouldn't come as a surprise to most people. However, will that stop you from devouring the contents in glee? Likely not. Or you'll denounce the book as ""fake"". Either way, this book will be polarizing and at the end of the day, I hope it doesn't impact your ability to be objective and skeptical.I typically do my reviews in a Pros/Cons format which is hard to pull off here. I can't really do that here: no winners or losers. Just people suffering from the current state of affairs regardless of who voted for which side and who didn't. Or who couldn't vote. If you dissect any person's life or approach to life like the author has done in this book, it's not hard to portray said life in any sort of outlandish manner. However, Trump makes it easy.Do you really want to read  about Gawker, Louise Mensch, WWE, Ms Universe and Trump? If so, you're in luck. This book has it all but I really recommend you pace yourself and put the book down. Or else you'll feel gluttonously disgusted with the contents you've gleefully gobbled if you chose to go that route. I mean do you really want to reminded of the blank sheets and empty binders? Do you? Well, you're in luck!I've docked a star because the sensationalist and outlandish tone of the book makes me wonder if what I've read is true. I'd have liked the author to have presented as bulletproof a publication as possible. However, as the author himself mentions, this book wasn't supposed to be: his initial effort was to catalog/keep an account of the administration's first 100 days. Turns out he got a bit more than he bargained for.

If Bannon could do it with such ease, then it is a pretty safe bet that the Russians are manipulating him on a  daily basis.Until yesterday, I had always considered Trump to be an idiot savant.  After reading this, I have come to the conclusion that he is just an idiot.  A probable medical diagnosis would be autism.  Considering his diet and lifestyle, he is probably suffering from vascular dementia.  Either way, he is not fit to be president.",January-6-2018,5

5447,"In spite of the co-ordinated push back against this book â€” from the pro-Trump media and from orthodox journalists who refused to burn their boats with the White House â€” this is a very good book. It is psychologically insightful about Donald Trump, his salesmanâ€™s mentality, and his obsession with his only saleable commodity - the Trump brand itself. The Donald has a New York real estate dealerâ€™s conception of a deal: you work the phones, schmooze, and get the suckers to like you. If a sucker doesnâ€™t like you â€” no sale â€” then a ton of invective and opprobrium is dumped on their head. If that ever worked in the Big Apple, it is not how you run an administration nor conduct diplomacy. If Donald were happy watching TV and tweeting while someone else ran the show, that might work. But he cannot bear being overshadowed and, one by one, anyone who gets more or better Press than him is out. The book concludes with Steve Brannonâ€™s assessment of the odds: 33% impeachment; 33% resignation following cabinet pressure; 33% the chaos continues to full term but The Donald does not seek re-election. While I am not temperamentally inclined to agree with Bannon, those odds look right to me.",January-11-2018,5

In Fire and Fury he penetrates a tight, self proclaimed towering group, and unlike other reporters, delivers the American public a detailed account of the inner workings of the White House.Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury as well written as it is, is an even greater display of strategic thinking.  To craft it, he penetrates the White House, and gets a President's inner circle to reveal unprecedented non-flattering details inside White House grounds. Startling!  One must ask, who else would have the intuitive thinking to pull it off?  And equally important, who could time a book release better or more fortuitous withing the context it plays?Michael Wolff not only is uniquely talented as an ""investigative information"" collector, he shows superior writing skills when it comes to transforming the raw data into a captivating narrative.",January-5-2018,5

The book affirms what we already know which is the Trump campaign wanted to win but didn't know what to do when they won. Trump comes across as a person who rules with an iron hand and only trusts his family. He is very quick to act and doesn't feel the need to become educated in governing. He can be charming and is impressed with people who are successful. People seem to be afraid of crossing him by disagreeing with him.",February-26-2018,3

Trump seems motivated chiefly out of a desire for universal attention and praiseâ€”and to establish his superiority. Most of his senior staff come off as scheming, leaking, and power hungry. Establishment Republicans here seem worried mostly about placating rich donors-letting the health industry lobby write the failed Trumpcare bill, for example. It is the story of a man imminently unqualified for the position he finds himself, tolerated by the establishment insofar as he is willing to sign whatever handout-to-the-rich bill Congress puts on his desk. Itâ€™s a fascinating train wreck.",January-7-2018,4

5492,"What is surprising about this book is that it's not all that surprising.  Michael Wolff has just put together the most comprehensive narrative about the complete disorganization in the Trump White House that has been obvious from Day One.  Although some of that may have improved with Bannon out and Kelly in, nothing will ever rein in Donald Trump, so the dam must constantly be plugged.  Just as the staff stamps out one fire, their boss fires another flame in another direction and they rush off to damp it down.  His inflated ego coupled with his childlike personality must be exhausting for those who find themselves, inexplicably, working for him.Were he not in a position which demands leadership skills coupled with a command of complex subjects, this book would be the political version of the Kardashians.  He's like an actor who managed to play the part of a businessman on t.v. but is finding playing the President more difficult, especially when others expect him to listen to them instead of hearing his endless stories. Thankfully, probably against all advice, Trump demanded that the publisher withdraw this book from publication which absolutely ensured it would be an overnight best seller.  As evidenced by the stunning number of reviews posted for a book published less than 36 hours before, even the most strident Trump supporters must know that freedom of the press is a bedrock of American democracy and that someone who is, like, very smart, should surely know that his actions would have the absolute reverse of what he intended.Of all the scary details in the book, none are as frightening as the thought that the guy at the top might throw a tantrum that could lead to far more serious consequences.  If Mr. Trump wants to prove he's, you know, like a genius, maybe he could volunteer to take a standard Scholastic Achievement Test and, if he can't score at least average, well, he should, you know, take a few classes and let some adults fill in for him until he learns basic sentence structure, what uranium is, and how to find, say, Kansas, on a map.  Or perhaps, like Barack Obama and Bill Gates, Mr.Trump could make a list of the ten best books he read in 2017.  As if.It's possible that in his former life, he made promises all the time that he was never going to keep.  He probably forgot within minutes that he'd made the promise, leaving bewildered people wondering what happened.  If they became an aggravation, he could sue or just block their calls.  He is, no doubt, doing the same thing to members of Congress and his own staff, some of whom may remain ever hopeful.  Good luck with that.",January-6-2018,5

The narrative of the author (and by obvious extension, Bannon) is designed (and feels contrived) to get us to believe that Trump and his people, couldn't have possibly colluded with the Russians because a.) they were massively inept, and b.) not one of them believed there was a chance in hell, that they could win.This narrative is tightly and systematically woven into the entire book.  It feels designed to re-direct our gaze away from even a possibility that Trump's entire team, as well as the Mercers' and Ailes, participated in, or had knowledge of, Russian collusion.  But this is not credible given the ""surprise"" primary wins.  Why wouldn't they believe that there was a path to victory, or at least a small possibility of one?This book feels like a carefully and surreptitiously crafted effort to throw shade on Russian collusion.",January-7-2018,5

Prior restraint is suppressing written material before it is disseminated.  It is only reserved for violations of trade secrets, sensitive medical information or matters of national security.Only Nixon, among modern Presidents, ever tried to suppress publication of events pertaining to the White House.Trump has not only shown himself to be an unstable and dangerous leader but truly a dictator who believes he can take our First Amendment rights away from us. Even if nothing in this book is true, Trump's actions in trying to suppress the book speak the most loudly. And I certainly suspect that much of the material in this book is true.Shame on Donald Trump and shame on us for electing this individual when we should have seen what was coming.Five star kudos for having the guts to write this.

5531,"Reading this is basically reading a CliffsNotes for 2017. If youâ€™re an avid news reader like me, youâ€™ll remember each and every one of these events, with the added bonus of the behind-the-scenes context Wolff provides.What I find most interesting about this book, which Stephen Miller decried as â€œa pile of garbage... poorly written fiction,â€ù is how plausible it all sounds. Thereâ€™s nothing here that strains credulity. The issue of Donald Trumpâ€™s mental stability? Weâ€™ve all been watching him ramble, repeat himself, and get lost in asides that go nowhere for two years now. And letâ€™s not forget the early morning tweets threatening nuclear war with â€œlittle rocket man(?)â€ù and bragging that DTâ€™s nuclear button is â€œbigger than his.â€ùThe stuff about Mueller investigating the Trump familyâ€™s money? We already know for a fact that he is, and we know because he brought a prosecutor onto his team who specializes in prosecuting money laundering . We also know he brought that prosecutor on not long after Trump said investigating his or his familyâ€™s finances would be a red line that would cause him to dismiss Mueller. Jared Kushner recently beefed up his team of lawyers by hiring one adept in defending people accused of white-collar money crimes. Coincidence?Especially galling is the constant bleating of â€œfake newsâ€ùfrom the White House. Whatâ€™s fake? The fact that DT Junior met with Russian operatives in Trump Tower, along with Manafort and Kushner? Their own emails confirm it. Is the claim that Trump wrote Juniorâ€™s statement about the meeting, which potentially obstructed justice? The White House acknowledged that he wrote it. The voice on the Access Hollywood tape-was that faked? Oddly, Trump now claims it was.It goes on and on and on and on and on. The statements made to Wolff during his interviews ring true, despite the claims of his sources. He may have printed off-the-record comments, according to what some have said, but since he wrote a couple of seemingly pro-Trump (or at least anti- anti-Trump) stories over the past two years, it seems more likely that Trump & Co. thought Wolff was looking to write a friendly book, and therefore he was given full access and carte blanche. Yikes.We all remember Trump defending white supremacist rioters after the debacle in Charlottesville cost a young woman her life. We all remember the so-called â€œtravel ban.â€ù We all remember the birther conspiracy Trump pushed (again exposing his ignorance of the Constitution; citizenship is automatically granted to the children of American citizens, regardless of what country they are born in.) all of this stuff happened, and to claim otherwise is gaslighting on such an enormous scale it literally boggles the mind.The biggest story here is that the Presidentâ€™s inner circle doesnâ€™t think much of him. Some wondered aloud to Wolff whether DT is only â€œsemi-literateâ€ù because of his aversion to reading. Others mention his propensity for simply leaving the room if an explanation becomes too detailed. Still others believe that he is senile, and point to the way he speaks. Many of his friends just call him stupid(!).On that note, itâ€™s best to acknowledge that anyone who said what these people said to Michael Wolff would of course try to deny or walk back their comments. Trumpâ€™s entire team, from Paul Manafort, Stephen Miller, Kellyanne Conway, etc.- including his kids-are nothing but a bunch of B and C team flunkies who latched on to their only ticket to the big time because no one else would have them.â€œFire and Furyâ€ù paints a picture of a president who is hypersensitive, angry, ignorant of his office and the Constitution that empowers it, and potentially senile (statistically possible, as by age 71, the odds are pretty high even when not factoring in his well known affinity for fast food, aversion to excercize, his obesity, and his own fatherâ€™s Alzheimerâ€™s diagnosis). At the very least, the fact that such an incurious and egotistical person could be elevated to our highest office must give us all pause.Update 1/14/18- Since this book was published, a number of people have questioned Wolffâ€™s credibility, accused him of making it all up, and claimed he published â€œoff-the-recordâ€ù quotes and information. But almost no one named in the book has stepped forward to dispute the broad outlines or their own comments as featured in the book; any that have, have done so only in the most half-hearted manner. That alone tells us a lot about Trumpâ€™s â€œteamâ€ù. #Winning",January-8-2018,5

5535,"The first half of the book is 5 stars and the last half is 3 stars as it becomes clear that Wolff's primary source is Bannon. I got the impression that as Bannon lost access to the inner circle so did Wolff. The last 4 chapters are Bannon's up and downs until he's finally ousted by what Bannon dubs ""Jarvanaka"".

5560,"Perhaps the most surprising thing to me about Fire and Fury is not that Trump apparently lost some his marbles during his scalp reduction surgery but that that Michael Wolff is actually a terrific writer.  After all, the book's main points are hardly revelations. But Wolff's sharp focus has somehow managed to create an emperor-has-no-clothes moment.About the writing:  One hears gripes, of course, from some reporters from major papers that Wolff does not follow their procedural conventions.  He never purported to do so.  But I wonder whether part of the reason for sour grapes is that Wolff can write circles around most of those reporters.  His prose is full of nuance, with detonations of diction that vacillates from the profane to the erudite, and with a vocabulary that no doubt is well beyond the reach of our semi-literate ""stable genius.""Another thing worth noting is that Fire and Fury actually is not about Trump; it's about the people around Trump.  Many of them are backpedaling from the book's content, even if they supplied that content.  But imagine that both Wolff and those West Wingers were subjected to a broad lie-detector test about the books content.  I have little doubt that Wolff would fare better.",January-8-2018,5

I was surprised to find, however, that it is well written and thorough, and it is clear that the author was meticulous in documenting all his interactions and interviews. Although we are all too familiar by now with Trump's character, this book is interesting because it shows how his inner circle operates, reacts, and plays off his simplistic and predictable behavior. Frankly, I am sick of hearing about the antics of Trump every single day, but I did enjoy reading this book to learn about the people around him. On a technical note, there were a few typos in the text (missing verbs, misspellings of names, etc), and I wish the editors had done better so it didn't undercut the credibility of the manuscript, but I do appreciate how quickly the book came out.",January-5-2018,5

Although I knew about many of Trump's *ahem* character flaws, the book sheds light on the ways he thinks and operates that still blew my mind. Although Trump and his team have been actively attempting to discredit and dismiss this book, you can tell very quickly as you read it that it's largely true.

So much to learn and discover, I think even an 'outsider' would be amazed how much turmoil occurs, hidden from the public, within the Whitehouse and at off-site meetings (often during working lunches, dinners, while on Air force One), and at myriad other venues.  It makes the reader dread what other shenanigans POTUS will pull as he staggers to the end of his term (unless he's impeached or convicted of a crime or multiple crimes) which would bring an immediate end to his lies, obstruction of justice, adinfinitum while 'acting' as POTUS.

It appears to have not had a thorough enough proof-read before being submitted for publication.That said, this book portrays Trump and his sycophantic enablers as a horrendous miscarriage of governance and a mortifying embarrassment to ANY thinking person. In that category, I give it an A+.",February-3-2018,3
5597,"I bought this to piss off our liar-in-chief. The funny thing is, normally I would never buy a book like this because of its author's dubious reporting methods but there have been sooooo many thoroughly resourced and researched stories from other new outlets that actually have reported on much of this. So as much as our despot of a President tries to deny, most of the American (and international) public know this is all probably true. Voting with my dollar today and will be voting in the booth in 2018 AND 2020!",January-7-2018,5
5598,I donâ€™t typically write reviews for newly released books but this one is important.  Trump shouldnâ€™t be president and never expected to be.,January-5-2018,5
5599,"A quick and easy book to read as so many of the characters are now so well known. Presumably the author is telling the truth, lest he incur a libel suit, this is a damning indictment on Trump, the Trump family and the dumb-fuck flunkies that hang off the Trump organisation.",January-12-2018,4
5600,"Sans the typos and the allegations of poor fact checking, the book supported most of what has been witnessed by the Trump White House.This was an enjoyable read.

5603,"If you're looking for an analysis of Trump's policies, don't waste your $. If you're looking for a book about the people in the WH in the early days of the Trump presidency, you found it.The author writes well, a fact overlooked by most of the media The press releases hinted @ a vengeful author, but that's not accurate. It isn't  that he forgives the errors made by the inexperienced Trump WH, it's that he understands why they could have happened.The teasers in the press release are all here, but they're surrounded by back story & front story & seem less harsh. This is a story about bumbling, prideful people who never expected their candidate to win. They all (including Trump) hoped to become rich(er) & famous from the campaign & go on with their improved lives when he lost.  No one had a policy on anything.By no one, I mean no one except Steve Bannon. There are no back stories or explanations softening Bannon's image. His takeover of the WH is astonishing & its no surprise when a bewildered Jared Kushner asks, ""What happened to Steve?""The media gets their share of fun-poking criticsm.  His description of small New York newspapers catering to the actions of the wealthy is spot on; you can just see the smugness radiating from the page. Disclaimer: I'm 1/2 way through the book & will update. I wanted to start a review to encourage Trump haters& Trump lovers to consider reading the book. It is NOT a book on policy",January-5-2018,4
5604,"I've read a good deal of this so far.  The first thing the reader MUST do is to put aside the fact that Wolff and Bannon have very serious conflicts with Trump.Do yourself a favor and avoid taking sides while reading Fire and Fury.It is NOT about how terrible Trump is (although, he is indeed a man with some disturbing self-perspectives)  It is NOT about why Trump shouldn't be where he is today, though he most certainly should not be.What it IS about, is how he got there; how he and his campaign literally scammed 62,979,879 voters with one goal in mind simply to improve his global standing - he didn't even want to win the election.  Rather; it was about the Trump brand and identity he would vastly improve upon had he become close to winning.If you do, I promise you that you will gain some extraordinarily disturbing and frightening facts about our election process and the insight into those who actually run this nation.Fire and Fury book is a dead serious look into the extreme delicateness of what we like to call ""our democracy."" It will shake your faith in our system; in humanity; and most of all, it will utterly destroy your false sense of empowerment in our current election system.You will walk away with a deeply disturbing reality that, due to big money, gerrymandering, and the Electoral College, just how unimportant your vote truly is.The book is extraordinarily intriguing and informative. As you read, remembering many recent wild and historical events, the ups and downs of Trump's behavior, his ever-changing policy directions and acidic remarks directed at all who don't kneel in praise of Donald J Trump SR, you begin to see the man who, with a complete lack of understanding of the global and domestic politics alike, Trump's vision, or utterly absent vision, one gets the very clear picture of the chaotic White House we've seen for now almost a year and the single most attributable cause for that chaos; Donald J Trump.You know?  We are constantly bombarded with cliches, one in particular; ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it"".  I cannot think of another example, living or dead, that the scenario in which we find ourselves today is more applicable.  If we fail to learn from this disastrous event, we, as a freedom-loving Republic will repeat it until we too are a page in history.",January-5-2018,5
5605,"It's the right book at the right time, and I wouldn't have bought it without Trump's enthusiastic non-endorsement. But let's face the fact that it's not great literature and probably will be forgotten shortly after Trump leaves office.",February-1-2018,3

5608,interesting but not much new information.,February-4-2018,3
5609,"Wolff has provoked a surge and deep conversation in a few days to stand up!  This book provides a Psychological profile into the lives of the Trump world. The Fathers of this great nation wrote the constitution to protect us from Trump.  How long will it take and how much suffering must we endure.  This book is a defining moment -25th Amendment should be the focus. ""Fire and Fury"" is tough read.",January-5-2018,5
5610,"I'm a retired, 23-year veteran print, radio and TV reporter and I have actually READ this book. Yes, there are  a few errors and sometimes lack of source attribution, yet FIRE & FURY is still an amazing piece of ""fly-on-the-wall""  journalism that reveals in convincing detail that our country has been captured by off-balanced, self-enhancing extremists who care about nothing othe than their own wealth, influence, and welfare. The author's front row White House observations literally chill the soul of any citizen who values the Rule of Law ""of the people, by the people, and FOR the people"" . Wake up, America, or in very short order, you will lose everything our Democracy has stood for. Don't be influenced by the ""Talking Heads"" on TV... Just read the book and decide for yourself the impact Trump's World is having on the core foundation of  our nation.  FACTS are knowable and facts matter-- and a vast majority of what is presented in this book rings true. On the other hand, ignore these facts at your peril...",January-12-2018,5
5611,A good read. Just validated everything we already know about the â€œOrange Emperorâ€ù and his band of fools. Please buy and make it a mega-bestseller!,January-10-2018,4
5612,"Revisit the past year... reminded me of stuff I had (thankfully) forgotten.  45 is not fit to be president.  He surrounds himself with incompetent people and he is stupid.  The errors reported do not impact the essence of the story.  We should be thankful for this book, it is in print what we innately know.  Shame on the Republicans for not being concerned more about the welfare of our nation.  Proof that this president Is incomptent  is that this book even exists.  45 and his people allowed the author to be there.....that is stupid.  Bannon is a James Bond evil villain and his banishment is his reward.  Glad I read it!",January-10-2018,5
5613,"This hilarious summary of the Trump presidencyâ€™s first year should horrify everyone concerned for the American commonweal. The occasional flaws that betray the hasty writing are easily overlooked as the overwhelming picture emerges of ineptitude and chaos in the White House, with their implications for our nation's governance, and possibly its future.â€œI sometimes do believe and sometimes do not: As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.â€ù (As You Like It, V,4)",January-10-2018,5
5614,"Gets right to the point. I believe what is written. Always possible there could be some exaggeration, but with the way ol Trump acts and talks, it all fits. The shameful thing is that people still support someone who tells lies and does things for his own benefit, not for the people and this points it out. The President is not a dictator and should work to unite people, not divide them, but you can see in this book that he selfishly serves himself, uses nepotism and sets himself up like a Czar and the foolish people who say they have a religion think he is great. Anyway, I think it was a good read.",January-30-2018,5
5615,"I bought this book because I heard the President threaten to sue. Considering how much has been denied by those quoted in it, it is hard to be overly confident in the truth. The fact that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump come off so badly presumably means they didn't talk to the author very much. But if it is, as the President says, a work of fiction, then it is a ripping good yarn!Even more than the President, Steve Bannon is the central literary character on the book, a modern-day Macbeth. Much has been made of his excerpted quote that Donald Trump Jr. was treasonous in meeting with Russian agents in Trump Tower in June 2016. But my favorite part is the rest of the paragraph, in which he explains, if you *were* going to collude with a foreign power, precisely how to go about it in a way that maintains plausible deniability!",January-11-2018,3
5616,Truly a masterpiece!,January-6-2018,5
5617,"Downloaded the audio version as soon as it became available and have listened to roughly one-half already. So far, it's been interesting. Have been aware of djt and his antics since the 1980's I can say that so far not too much is revelatory here . However, the author does provide some psychological profiles, backstory and chronology  which should be informative to those less familiar with the crimes and misdemeanors  of our narcissistic conman  White House inhabitant and the company he keeps.",January-6-2018,4
5618,Only 1/3 of the way through.  Very good though some writing mistakes.  Loved the part where Trump addresses the FBI.  My jaw dropped when I watched that on the news.,January-5-2018,5
5619,"The content is incredible and - if true - confirms a lot of my personal opinions me of what has been happening in the Trump White House. However, the information on the political factions is enlightening. On the negative side, it drags in the middle and could use better editing.",January-11-2018,5
5620,Feeling a little more hopeful than I have since Election Day. This book is a small glimmer to help us to live through this nightmare. Besides confirming what more than half of our country already knew it exercises one of our greatest freedoms. Imagine trying to stop the publication of a book because you donâ€™t like what it says!?!!? Can someone kindly remind Mr. Trump that this is AMERICA and we have rights here.,January-5-2018,5
5621,I'm glad Michael Wolff had the opportunity and stones to put his observations and thoughts down on paper because this was an amazing read. I would have liked if he had clarified the bits that cannot be 100 verified from the ones that are backed up by evidence but I won't knock a star off for that because this is groundbreaking information regardless. Every single republican that supports Trump (especially after reading this book) needs to be voted out of office. All of them. I don't even care if they are replaced by other republicans as long as they publicly state they will defend our country from Trump.,January-6-2018,5
5622,I understand Trump better now. He never expected to be elected therefore no tax returns and no divesting of businesses.  He can campaign but not govern.  Bought the book because he tried to ban it.  It could have used more editing but is still a fascinating read.  Like watching a car wreck you can not take your eyes off of he careens through the White House.,January-9-2018,4
5623,"Fantastic read. Well written, believable, scary as hell. Every American needs to read this to get an understanding of just how much chaos and dysfunction exists in this administration and the peril we face as a nation. Holy cow!",January-30-2018,5
5624,Writing style and vocabulary.,March-11-2018,5
5625,Thought it is a good read but we are living in frightening times with Trump as president.  Can hardly believe such a man is our president and the people who surround him have their hands tied even if they are capable.  Sad and tough time for America.,January-14-2018,5
5626,Very dry read.,March-15-2018,2
5627,"Worth the 15.00 & first amendment.  Dropped a jaw, giggled, and even rolled over a couple of times laughing.  There are some descriptions i just can't get out of my head now; just like, moments in life one just didn't need to visually see.  Good read.",January-5-2018,5

5629,"I read this in one day, starting early, going into the night. It is really great, his style is a bit like Dominick Dunne. He is there, mingling, people tell him things.

Wise readers would come to this book with a grain of salt to leaven the hysteria. Still, even if half-true, Wolfeâ€™s portrait of a White House thrown into chaos by a capricious chief executive is worth reading.",January-30-2018,3
5632,"Anyone who reads this book and still thinks that Trump is still fit to be serving as the President of the United States is seriously delusional and needs to check their critical thinking skills. While i know that some of the book has inaccurate information, I know that most of this account is true (via references and proof sites).... History will record this book as a bellweather in the destruction of the Presidency by the most unfit, unqualified, biggest liar to ever be President of the United States. The sooner he is removed, the better it will be for the future of our country... and I think it will be soon.",January-6-2018,5

5638,"I bought this book in defiance of a threat to the author but after reading it, I think everyone should read this book. Of course, those who need to read it the most are those who believe the lies coming from the WH and don't believe the truth in the media. I am a student of politics and have paid very close attention to what has been going on over the last 2 years. This book rings very true and has been backed up by many of the people who are in a position to know.  Do I believe every single word to be the literal truth? No, but I do believe the basis to be true and it is terrifying.  Our celebrity-worshipping, ignorant of civics electorate has elected a dangerous and unstable man to the most important office in the world and I am horrified that he is supported by so many who KNOW there is a problem with him.  I only pray this book helps to make sure there is a check on this man until his crimes have been uncovered and he has been removed from office.",January-11-2018,5
5639,I found it to be an entertaining read.  I found myself agreeing with those who have stated that it simply adds some flavor and depth to stories that have been around for months.  I found it to more sad than amusing in many parts.  Particularly when reminding myself that this is supposedly non-fiction.  It was a good book.  Not great.  Far from a waste of time.,January-11-2018,3
5640,"If a similar, tell all, book had been written about President Obama, and he had cried out ""phony book"" and ""Michael Wolff is a total loser"", well, I would have thought to myself, hmm, this Michael Wolff is obviously a loser and his book is no doubt phony. Why, you ask? Because Barack Obama never gave me a reason to distrust him and I would believe what he told me.In this circumstance however, I'm reminded of another wolf, one who's name was falsely shouted by a boy(think man-child in this case) until no one cared or believed what was said and as you likely already know, the story didn't end well for the boy.Since Donald Trump has given me absolutely no reason to believe anything he says, I'm going to go with my gut and surmise that this book is no doubt spot on. And a good read too. But scary if you love our democracy, which is rapidly vanishing under Trump.",January-7-2018,5
5641,"This could have been a great book. All the ingredients are here. Unfortunately, the author fell into the Trump Trap and got carried away. While he wanted to give us the feeling of ''sitting on the couch'' in the White House with him, he destroyed that by using words in every other sentence never seen by ninety percent of his working-class readers. Fortunately, my Kindle has a built-in dictionary.Having said that, this is still a must-read for anyone trying to figure out what the hell is going on in the People's House.",January-11-2018,3

The constant, sometimes, bitter and malicious friction between the Jarvanka and Bannonite camps become comical in the mist of serious domestic and world issues.

An overuse of obscure or rarely used words, such as: aphoristic, shambolic (which I found is a Briticism), voluble, cosseted, solipsism, indefatigability, and a real corker, one I've never seen, PERSIFLAGE. For a book dealing basically in what I consider to be gossip, these are fancy words. I'm guessing he thinks this lends some kind of intellectual aura to his ""writing""...IN MY OPINION. I don't mind turning to the dictionary for unfamiliar terms, but his use of  bulky terms where plain English would work better and have a better effect for the reader is unfortunate, and frankly tiresome and distracting.

There are some inconsistencies exist between accounts, but  everything as written is plausible... which as an American I find more than a little disturbing.Were President Trump to have an analogue in the Lovecraft Mythos he would be Azathoth, the blind elder god who must be constantly entertained by the music of his court dancing about him lest he sink the universe into primordial chaos.",January-11-2018,4

I think the author pretty well summed up his own book while causually backhanding Kushner and the New York Observer. â€œThere may never have been such a self-conscious and self-referential publication as the New York Observer.â€ù Well...  perhaps there is now.Itâ€™s entertaining, to be sure. (Though it was obviously rushed to print and is full of typos and grammatical errors.) Itâ€™s also exactly what you expect having been subjected to Trumpâ€™s incoherent speeches and absurd tweets for nearly a year. I donâ€™t quite get the criticism about the â€œfancy wordsâ€ù unless words like disheveled and calamitous bother you. But the author is certainly quite proud of himself, and the tone throughout drips superiority. Still, considering the subject matter, and the fact he got himself on there, that is almost understandable.  It would be more compelling in a more neutral tone, but clearly his goal is only to sing to the choir, so...But I still gave it 5 stars because, ya know, cease and desist...",January-7-2018,5

The tome (tomb?) documents much of what is obvious; parts true, parts speculation & part bumper sticker politics.

He was materially aided by the fact that its inhabitants have/had little to no idea what they were/are doing. Wolff says enough disparaging things about liberals to indicate that this was not a partisan chop job, but one based on the ability to do the job of running the government. He spared only the competent from his cuts; Sally Yates, Katie Walsh, and at some level Dina Powell were the only survivors. The language was punchy with an identifiable Jersey sensibility (if you're from there). Whether you like the outcome or not, it's a singular journalistic achievement.",January-10-2018,5

It offers great insight into the inner workings of the Trump administration, and the author is very well-spoken. I think there's something for almost everyone in it, whether you are a critic or a supporter. You can decide for yourself if it's true or not, but you have to read it to know. :)",January-7-2018,5

There was too much meandering to keep my interest.  I really did not learn anything new by reading this that I had not heard on television, radio or on line.  I am glad I read it because I donâ€™t like others to determine what is important in a book, but this time I could have spared myself.  I think the rush to get this book published prevented thorough editing.  There were a number of simple typos and sentence structure issues that needed to be tweaked.  I found myself rereading sentences to understand where he was headed.  This is why I would not recommend someone buying the book.

Reveals why the office of the President of the United States is NOT a Part-Time Entry Level Job but one that requires a responsible adult willing to actually work and govern the country, not an old fart who just wants to play golf and eat ice cream.

5694,"Based on my having read a couple of reviews and heard other reports on MSNBC, I was not expecting the kind of content that would come from a more thoroughly researched, better written book from the pen of a presidential historian.  I pretty much got what I expected.  The book gives evidence of hasty preparation and not-well-thought-out organization.  Even so, I found the Wolff book to be fascinating in places and confirming of the weirdness of the Trump White House.  The focus on Bannon, Kushner, and ""Jarvanka"" left me wondering how anything at all gets done in this Trumpian world.  Does anyone at all really know ""who's on first""?  Is there a semblance of a chain of command, even with GEN Kelly as chief of staff?  I'm glad I purchased and read ""Fire and Fury.""  Bottom line, if only one-third of the book is factual, then our country is indeed in a mess.  After we somehow rid this wonderful nation of the Trump presidency, I predict that it will take ten years to un-do the influence of Trump and his base.  Alas!",February-20-2018,3

5702,"Fire and Fury dominated the news cycle last week and I succumbed, not knowing if the book would be readable. Wolfe clearly got the bulk of his information from Bannon (Iâ€™d be interested in knowing whether Bannon is receiving a cut of the profits), but it is also clear that the author had access to the White House during Bannonâ€™s tenure. Ultimately, this book brings together all the prurient details that kept us interested in the Trump presidency during its first several months.",January-11-2018,3

5705,"Written a bit chaotically.  Seemed to be mostly about what Bannon thinks of Trump.  Both, as well as the rest of the characters, and they are characters, came across as self aggrandizing loonies.  Which, by the way, is basically how they have been portrayed all along by press and other reports and themselves.  I found little new information in the book which I had not already gleaned myself.  But still horrifying, none the less.  How could this have happened is a question we still need to figure out and do something to keep it from happening ever again.",January-11-2018,3

5707,"I thought the book is an important contribution to the analysis of the competency of the president. It portrays Trump's weaknesses in all manner of things: temperament, intellect, morality, judgment, balance, motivation, and so on. It also portrays an incredibly dysfunctional White House with competing factions and astonishing ineptitude. Clearly the president is woefully unqualified to be president, his staff is similarly out of its league, and the result is an ongoing catastrophe. The author is a decent writer. My main criticism of the book is that it is often unclear whether Wolff's assertions and quotations are literal or deduced. Nonetheless, it is impossible to dispute that Donald Trump is grotesquely unfit for the office and the people around him are no better.",January-28-2018,4
5708,"Amazing and horrifying. People, I remember Dwight Eisenhower! The GOP would sneer a  t him today, he was an honorable man. Nixon was weird and paranoid, but he was intelligent; a statesman. The Bushes? meh. Too embroiled with the Saudis. And now we have a demagogue, an infantile out of control manchild, and America seems to be stuck for the moment. This book has its hilarious moments, but underneath it all is the sadness that dementia rules DC now.  Anyway, read it. Then read Sinclair Lewis' ""It Can't Happen Here""........(quote) Doremus Jessup, the protagonist of Sinclair Lewis's 1935 novel â€œIt Can't Happen Here,â€ù sees something dark and terrible brewing in American politics â€” the potential for â€œa real fascist dictatorshipâ€ù led by the up-and-coming populist candidate Berzelius Windrip. ... â€œThat couldn't happen here in America, not possibly!â€ù  (unquote)Oh yes it can.

5709,I have watched the events described in this book unfold over the past two years.  Reading this account of these events in sequence with some insights into why and how many strange and unacceptable actions took place was helpful.  Nothing was truly new or surprising to those of us who have been following the Trump phenomenon but might be to many.  It's an easy read although a bit of a horror story.  I think we need a second book to cover the next year of this unusual presidency.  It might be titled The Fall of the Republican Party.,January-16-2018,4

5717,"Fire and Fury reads well as a contemporaneous report of the early Trump presidency.  Most observant viewers of current events will have reached similar conclusions, Donald Trump is a simple minded narcissist incapable of higher thought processes, a juvenile personality who managed to fool twenty five percent of registered American voters and win the office.  If the quotes sited (There are few actual quotes footnoted, unattributed sources abound.) are to be trusted, Trump is every bit the buffoon caricature that he has presented himself to be through his tweets, and public rambling speeches.Michel Wolff has written a concise account, but not a deep cover expose.  It may well prove useful in the future to chronicle the Trump years to those too young, or too naive to understand what they see in current news cycles, but for others it only adds to their contempt for the President by adding more noise to the anti-Trump echo chamber.I am pleased that I bought and read this book, I am not sufficiently impressed that I will follow Michael Wolff and buy other books that he may write.  Had the President not made the book noteworthy by his attentions, I doubt that I would have bought it.  I never bought any of Kitty Kelly's tell all books and discounted her work as yellow journalism unworthy of support.",January-6-2018,4

5728,"I had already pretty much figured out Trump from the first day of his ""Presidential campaign"".But my question is: how could so many people possibly think Trump would care about anyone else but himself? The Grab 'em by the **** revelation didn't phase his voters, or not releasing his tax returns, while CLEARLY not knowing or caring how the US government works much less what the Constitution says or the rule of law.When he WAS elected he was mortified. All Trump really wanted was to finish 2nd and to continue his money making endeavors with his own cable network - Trump TV.This is a crook and con man with DEEP financial ties to mob figures and Russia. Somehow, in his unimaginative 8 year old mind, thought all this would not come out. Or if it did, as President (he thinks Dictator/King) he could order citizens to ignore it all - it was a great big nothing burger.Trump also thought he could sue, even jail journalists and shut down the press. Trump thought he could order the DOJ and FBI to bend to his every desire. Those agencies work for the United States people NOT Trump.I purchased this book because I am a very concerned citizen. I am a Veteran and find Trump being in the Presidential office to be abhorrent. I believe in freedom of the press and no one is going to tell me what I can and can not read.Since he makes my head nearly explode every time he tweets or even speaks - I hope my book purchase contributes to paying him back in kind.",January-5-2018,5

5731,"OK, so this is a no-class indulgence read and not a book you should rely on for accuracy. Wolff writes a lot of speculation and innuendo worded as if it is the truth. Read with a big dash of salt if you don't see quotes. Some of his news interviews after the book release were telling - he gets as slippery as Carter Page when pressed on some issues.I treated it as entertainment and enjoyed it for that. No particular earth-shaking insights, except how crazy the current White House must be.",February-14-2018,3

5733,Very interesting. Well written.,January-23-2018,5
5734,"Like many, I have followed the months since January 20, 2017 with increasing horror and despair. I'm no more of a political junkie than your average bear, but immediately became intrigued as soon as Trump denigrated Wolff and even tried to staunch the book's release. Also notable to me is the curious lack of any specific denials from Trump's camp about the specifics of what was said. (Billionaire Mercer denying a quote or two is about as specific as it gets.) Clearly, Wolff collected a lot of smoke, and that smoke is somewhat analogous to a fire.Amongst journalistic circles, Wolff is regarded with suspicion, and unlike Trump, I heed the words of journalists, so I read taking any revelations with a grain of salt. However, anticipating the charge of ""fake news,"" it appears Wolff also has hours of recordings of his subjects. Lordy, there are tapes.The book is engagingly written, with an air of can-you-believe-this-shit (no, most of us can't) and oodles of palace intrigue. I was fascinated that Melania was briefly mentioned - she desperately didn't want Trump to win - and then was a non-starter for the rest of the book. It's clear she isn't truly part of that world. Hope Hicks, Trump's now-28-year-old assistant, gets quite a few mentions in the book. Who is she - what's her deal? I found myself wanting to know more.Much of the book is spent on Steve Bannon, aka ""Darth Vader,"" and the revelation at the end that he is seriously considering a 2020 presidential run? In the words of the ill-fated Sean Spicer (whose demise is chronicled in this tome) ""You can't make that shit up.""The biggest reveal of the book (and there are many) is that it's worse than we all thought - Trump is the Chauncy Gardner president, Caligula on steroids. He's a cipher - a nothing. There's nothing to analyze because there is nothing there. The book truly made me wonder if the 25th Amendment will get dusted off anytime soon, complacent Congress be damned.It's worth a read for the palace intrigue alone.God help us all.",January-6-2018,5
5735,"I bought this book solely because of the threat to keep it from being sold. The book itself is OK, and many of the claims Wolff makes are not specific and unsubstantiated. However, if you like palace intrigue and gossip columns, this is the book for you. It's like game of thrones, but the decapitations are metaphorical.",January-11-2018,2
5736,"Fundamentally important. The ring of truth as loud as the liberty bell -- what we've known about DJT from the tweets, we now know from the voice of a man who sat on a couch, observed, and wrote everything down. We're in uncharted territory -- whatever your political leaning, the chaos of the man at the top, the lack of executive functioning, has placed us all in peril. And Michael Wolf has detailed it all, admirably.",January-8-2018,5
5737,"Having lived through the news cycles, it was good to see this all put together with insight.  The book was put together hastily and could use some editing.

5738,"A real revelation regarding the madness in the White House.  It confirms that some people will do anything for fame and money.  That wealth, power, fame come before country.  The book confirms my fear for the destruction of American  values and humanity and respect around the world.  The book is a hard read as there appeared to be purposefully placed words and jargons that did nothing to get the point across.  They were not cohesive with the overall language used.  They did not enhance the meaning or clarify the ideas or thoughts of the author.",January-11-2018,3

5740,"""fire and fury"" paints a disturbing portrait of the Trump White House and it's cast of characters. Though much has been speculated on, Wolff seems to confirm the idea that Trump is a ranting, reactionary fool, while those around him are equally deluded opportunists.Most of the material appears to come from Bannon, a smug blowhard who cannot help but let those around him know hes smarter and more self righteous than they are, a predictably combustible attitude. The book does not, however, delve too deeply into the reality of Bannon's influence. Is he an architect of alt-rights populism and racial hatred? Can he effectively persuade and channel such energies? Whatever the case, the book portrays his almost-year in the White House as the inevitable rise and fall of a second-rate provocateur, one who fell into the trap of believing their own hype...much like Trump!That story is compelling. But it is not quite the tale the book promises. the gross dysfunction  of the  Trump White House is too often glossed over, without truly shocking details save for a handful of hissy fits. Readers will come away with characterizations of the ""mysterious"" Bannon, the banal ambitions of ""Jarvanka"", and maybe Hope Hicks (she comes off like a naive dope). But the backstabbing and dealmaking and temporary alliances-the kind of stuff that might make the Trump administration a sadder stupider version of ""house of cards"" or even ""game of thrones""-isnt quite there.",January-15-2018,4

What it does lack is the importance of risk to the country with this unstable White House.

5748,"The book's well written and pulls together so lot of documented and well established information about the Trump operation.  It focuses pretty much with recent activities and not the earlier alleged financial ties to a variety of underworld groups, especially several in New York.  There are a few minor errors perhaps because of haste in getting it out in print.  Those are unfortunate but hardly significant in light of the facts reported.  Just gives critics a something to snip about.Overall, my view is that the book is valuable in pulling a lot of things together in one place, and providing a lot of documentation filed away in notes and tapes from interviews.  It does present a relatively negative picture of Trump as a person and much more as someone who lacks the intelligence and skill set to be President of the United States.Guess the whole read makes me a bit sad to see our politics slide down to such a low point, but finding just Trump.  Too many members of the Congress,, Senate and House, fail to measure up - and the leadership of both Houses really appears the worst since at least WW II.Didn't want to digress - but I guess the digression reflects a lot of the feelings the book has left with me.

I think it opens a door on the real Trump for who he really is. Hopefully people will see this for what it is. Enjoy! _Ÿ˜„,January-12-2018,4
5771,"Watching this clown car plow down Pennsylvania Avenue, I feel as though the author captured my exact sentiments. Yes, America, we are in trouble.",January-17-2018,5
5772,"I bought this book because I was intrigued and pretty excited to see what goes on in the White House behind the scenes. Look, Iâ€™m not a Trump fan, but the way the â€œauthor who had so much access to the White Houseâ€ù wrote this book was just sad and demeaning. He had so many really really nasty and brutal comments about trump and nearly most of it I found myself questioning how on earth those â€œfactsâ€ù could be true or how the author even found some of the information he did.Like I get that youâ€™re biased, but this was too hard for me to read. I mean he just bashes the president left and right and is relentless about it. I only ended up reading a few chapters and I really donâ€™t plan on picking the book up again.",April-25-2018,1
5773,I am enjoying the kindle book. Highlighting feature is cool. Subject matter is very disheartening though because the chaos inside the White house is worse than I thought.  Agree with another's comment to spring for audible book.  Person reading is wet behind the ears young and it helps the medicine go down.,January-5-2018,5
5774,"There are some mistakes; some appear to be from hasty editing to get the book out quickly. But it is deliciously, wickedly revealing and his writing style is witty and urbane. If you love Vanity Fair you will love it. It's also terrifying in its reveal of this monstrous mistake in the White House.",January-14-2018,5
5775,There is nothing surprising or shocking on these pages. Events of the past year have almost numbed the reader from the usual shock and awe that these kind of revelations would normally incite.The question will be how damaged is the Republican party after making a conscious decision to overlook the damage of a Trump presidency to fulfill their agenda.I hope it is not too late to restore faith in Democracy and the institutions of its construct.It seems a very steep climb.,January-11-2018,4

5779,"Not a surprise to Trump-haters and not read by Trump-supporters, this book gives a more detailed look at the obvious chaos taking place in the Trump Administration. Definitely portrays Steve Bannon to be the scary â€œdamn them all to Hellâ€ù character that he seems to be.",January-25-2018,3

5781,"A must-read for every American citizen. And for every person living on this planet!This book has been a surprise to me - not that Trump's wacky behavior is surprising - but more than the book shows that everyone around him *knows* he is completely unqualified to lead anything and is incapable of ever acting or being ""Presidential"". They knew this when he decided to run, and never expected he would win, hence why his 'administration' has been a complete shambles from day one.The book is very well written, interesting and a page-turner. My only problem with it is that we still don't know how it will end. With some of the things this man has done and said lately, my big fear is that it will end with our country embroiled in numerous wars - and this giant 3 year old with his finger on THE BUTTON.One recommendation/tip: get the 'free with a free trial subscription' Audible audiobook version, too, and make LOTS of popcorn!",January-6-2018,5

Nineteen of our US presidents have been republican.  Whether or not you admire them or support their policies, they are one of two of our political parties...our Grand Old Party.I don't usually review books. Here on Amazon I only occasionally review such things as ice makers and iPhone covers.So why do I feel compelled to enter the very treacherous waters of our current political insanity by posting here?  Because tonight our Grand Old Party sent out a ridiculous tweet that mocked up a cover of this book replete with ""reviews"" that disparaged (perhaps correctly...I don't know) the author.It isn't the mock-up itself that disturbs me as much as the fact one of our two leading political parties has stooped to trashing books. This is beneath us. Or it should be beneath us.I apologize that this isn't a book review. I'm only 1/4 the way through. But from what I can tell so far this is a gossipy, somewhat breezy, breathless impression of the early days of this administration. It could be called a ""romp"" if it weren't true. If true, it is both disheartening and a bit scary.  But it doesn't require an entire political party to make fun of it. Instead it requires an entire political party to fix it.(Amazon deleted my earlier review so I'm reposting it.  Not sure why they removed it but I might have, in error, linked to Wikipedia...so let's see if this one sticks!)",January-6-2018,4

The vocabulary exceeded my own and I pride myself on my vocabulary. Also, there are references to people or events that I am not familiar with.Other than that, isn't this what we all thought was happening anyway? I guess it's good to get it documented and all in one place. Make this insanity more coherent, put a timeline and the players in order. There were several interesting interactions and the backbiting was more pervasive than I would have imagined. I'd say the people most surprised by it are the people in it.

This book sounds real and I like to think that I can make those determinations on my own, although I'm sure there are some falsehoods too. It doesn't put the President in good light. I will continue to hope the best for the country, but this book definitely puts some ideas in your head. Worth a read for sure. Thank goodness for Kindle versions or I'd have to wait a few days to read. It was sold out on Amazon and our local bookstore.

They were not prepared one bit for him to actually win, saying they would handle problems later, thinking that there would be no ""later"" as president, because he wouldn't win, right?  He was prepared, however, to claim the election was stolen (and he even made reference to it that in one of his evangelical-type speeches when he warned everyone that the election would be rigged---which it was).  Trump went from not wanting the job to believing that it was his destiny.I love that this book is written by the proverbial fly-on-the-wall because Trump gave the author full access to the West Wing and his myrmidons, apparently thinking that Wolff would find no dirt, just adulations.",January-7-2018,5

The story is a great insider tale of how one man's ego got the best of him and he was elected to an office he did not want. The ultimate con job on the American people.I especially enjoyed that Trump did not want this published.  He wanted to stop it from being printed. That in itself is reason to purchase the book.I am only 1/4 of the way through the book, but it is evident that America has someone in an office he was not prepared for, not deserving of and incapable of handling even the smallest of things with style and grace.",January-5-2018,5

It was apparently the final straw in the political ex-communication of Steve Bannon, and much ado is being made about it. In order to have an opinion about it myself, I had to read it.

5815,"The book reads like an excellent White House fanfic, which is great fun at first. But then you remember ""this all actually happened, and continues to happen"", and it's more than just a bit terrifying. If that wasn't enough, a sitting President of the United States actively attempted to silence the free speech of a citizen by suppressing the release of this book. That should be reason enough for anyone who considers themselves a true patriot to purchase and furiously read through it.Regardless of your political leanings, we now have a clear, referenced exposÃ© of how this attempt at ""draining the swamp"" ironically consisted of dumping 1000s of tons of toxic waste right back in, then letting it sit stagnant because the Command-in-Chief didn't even want to be there in the first place.",January-5-2018,5
5816,Factual? Maybe. Interesting?  Certainly.Even if you regard the lack of attribution and other journalistic basics as cause to be skeptical the book is very entertaining. All of the anecdotes are unlikely to be accurate but the overall themes and impressions are damning enough. A largely disinterested and uneducable president surrounded by three warring factions all out for themselves. Deep concern voiced by all factions concerning the lack of focus and gravity given to the most serious issues facing the country. Wether or not you choose to believe it on face value it was a quick and interesting read. If even 10% of it is true itâ€™s still the political read of the decade.,January-11-2018,4

5818,"As I read this book, I kept thinking ""When is he going to get to the shocking stuff we don't already know?""  I'm still waiting. It was mildly amusing, like watching a soap opera. The author's writing style struck me as extremely tabloid. For me, the best part was the claim that Sean Spider's daily mantra was ""You can't make this sh*t up."" The rest was just a rehash of the first nine months of the Trump presidency.",January-26-2018,3

I think it is hilarious that the White House allowed the author to walk in and take a seat, for a year, after all of the complaining about the press, and have no clue!  !  Makes me feel so much safer with this inept group is running my country.  Common sense is lacking and all of DT tweet storms illustrate a man-child who never learned basic social skills in school.  If I have to hear him utter another put down, I think I will puke. I realize that it is a minor thing compared to the racism of this administrations, but his daily name calling only confirms DT doesn't understand the basics of being a contributing member to anything, much less the human race.. He doesn't respect others - because underneath his verbal outrageousness, is a man who is painfully aware at the core of his being, that he is unloved for good reason.  The sad part is he has used hate to elevate himself at the expense of our country.",January-11-2018,5
5836,This is the book that Donald Trump deserves. He has earned it with every single day of his presidency.And the author will become disgustingly rich with it. I don't mind contributing to that. It's for a good cause.Not because it's the truth.

5844,"The book did have some grammar issues, and not everything is a direct quote. But enough is direct quotes, from named sources, to make me think that the general idea of the book is solid. Direct quotes can usually be verified by recordings or a the moment notes. I also thought that many of the more insightful comments are not ones you hear about on the news. Now I am not seeing signs of dementia in Trump's actions, which I am very familiar with, it seems more to me that he may be feeling his age, or even more, he is has the personality of the guy who is forever a teenager. Everyone knows a guy who is locked into his image of what he was when he was 18. He acts just like the dumb jock, which is not a crime or a 25th amendment thing.Reality is that the country elected a 70yr old guy trapped in his dumb jock view of himself. Until we make a law saying you have to act like an adult to be president, his day to day behavior is not enough to get rid of him",January-11-2018,4

5847,Finished it in less than 24 hours. Nothing was suprising but seeing behind the curtain is astonishing. I finished this book feeling a lot more pity for Trump than I had in the past. The guy is just an insecure ball of putty. Able to be molded by anyone in proximity. Yikes. Bannon 2020? That is even more terrifying. The most heart wrenching take away I felt is that not once in any of these quotes and discussions was the will or the need of the American people ever mentioned (even as leverage) by anyone. #feelthebern,January-6-2018,5
5848,"So which is it? Is the book totally false, or is Bannon a backstabber? Because you canâ€™t have both! If the book is false then Bannon didnâ€™t say all the juicy things that peppers this book, and if Bannon DID really say these things, then the book must not be so false after all!  With all his bluster and fight to dismiss this book, I had to buy it! The fact that he tried to stop publishing, and the fact that the publisher, in defiance, moved up the release date, made me buy this book immediately!  Iâ€™ve been reading it for a good part of the day and Iâ€™m about 1/3 of the way through. As the previous reviewer stated, you are surprised but not surprised, it just confirms what weâ€™ve all been thinking the whole time, but I canâ€™t put it down! Itâ€™s like a car wreck, you canâ€™t help but look! It confirms the mental instability and total chaos that are the hallmarks of this crazy time weâ€™re forced to live in. The book itself is engaging and entertaining, but then you remember that this is who is running our country, and becomes scary. This book causes both laughs and nausea at the same time. There are a lot of long, run on sentences, and the author does go off on mini-tangents sometimes making it hard to follow his main thought. But still, it deserves nothing less than 5 stars, to do my part to get it on and keep it on the best seller list! Got the Kindle version, because I didnâ€™t want to wait two weeks. But I plan on buying the hardcover, too.",January-6-2018,5
5849,"I ordered as soon as the Orangutan in Chief started tweeting about it, originally said it would arrive in 2 days, then said it would be 4-6 weeks, but I got it a little over a week later and in one night I read the first three chapters.  I can't say that I know that every bit of the book is factual, but with the level of insight that Wolff has into the inner workings of the WH and the campaign, and a common sense look at everything that transpired, I have to say that Wolff seems to have written a legitimate representation of the events that occurred.  I recommend reading this book if you want to make it a NYT best seller and annoy the hell out of Donald or want some insight into the workings of our current executive branch, but definitely buy this book if you want the former",January-17-2018,5

5851,"Even if some of this book is embellished, it's exactly what most people believe  happened. Honestly, I was not too shocked to read about Trump and co. Even just following normal news you can get the picture that these events are like what this book is about.I have no doubts that this book is a pretty accurate telling of this White house. It just makes me sick to think these people are in charge of our country. That they are making the decisions that greatly effect my life. I truly hope we can survive this horrible man and his people.",January-11-2018,5
5852,Interesting info on the split among the wh advisors. Obviously vetting the author's sources is key to what you can learn.,January-19-2018,4
5853,"This was an interesting read.  Every detail doesn't have to be true because the overwhelming amount of information in the book, and the lack of denials from those quoted, is convincing.  It tells the story of a White House with horrendous infighting and not much competency.",January-25-2018,5
5854,"I bought this because trump tried to censor the book. I read it in one sitting. It confirms every single impression that I have of this Ronald McDonald presidency. And the complicit jaundiced cynical Republicans that prop him up because ""he'll sign anything we put in front of him"". History will be harsh on these shameless traitors to our democracy.",January-6-2018,5
5855,"The book was interesting, confirmed many news stories butWas really nothing more than what we have already known. Worth reading",January-24-2018,3
5856,Congrats to Wolff who struck gold on a book of historical significance thanks to a cease and desist order from the POTUS.  Every American should read this book and judge for themselves what hidden truths that warranted such an attack on the 1st Amendment.,January-13-2018,5
5857,Seemed rush to publication. But reveals Trump and Jarvanka for their bad management.,January-17-2018,4

5859,I just like the book he was so honest about what he WROTE TRUMP IS A JERK,February-16-2018,5
5860,"If only a FRACTION of the stuff in this book is true, it's very depressing and also infuriating.  As someone who despises Trump, this book only served to make me more angry.  What incompetence, what buffoonery, what an unfit, uninformed nightmare of a man and president.",February-7-2018,5
5861,"Self-serving, despicable people are in charge of our government! This was a tedious but very worthwhile read. The author took most of the major events through August and described  what each of the three competing White House factions were doing. Horrifying to think Jared and Ivanka, with no experience other than schmoozing and self promotion have such a big role in our countryâ€™s future. The nepotism law should be strengthened!  Trumpâ€™s vulgarity, stupidity and lack of work ethic are appalling.  He has made our country the laughingstock of the world- far from the greatness he promised. I canâ€™t believe the Republicans are such lemmings.",January-14-2018,5
5862,I bought the kindle version and have only read up to the initial inaugural address and the comments about Spicer turning into a laughingstock.  Goes beyond expectation and shows the administration as even worse than what we have all seen in the news.Our â€œdear leaderâ€ù has done real genuine harm to our country and democracy as a whole.  Iâ€™m sad and angry it had gotten to this point and can commiserate with another reviewer thinking we had to do better for our kids.,January-5-2018,5
5863,"1) I'm not even American. I can't believe I was just intrigued enough about American politics to have purchased this book at 09:01 on the day of release. But we are living in a whole new world, there is a lot of hype about this book, and this guy might start a nuclear war that would kill us all. 2) I have literally never been more excited to be going on a long-haul 24 hour flight now that I have this book in my kindle. It might make me sick, but at least I'll be entertained.",January-5-2018,5
5864,"I was going to review michael Wolffâ€™s new book, Fire and Fury, rather than the political agenda that caused it to be written, but the reasons behind the writing makes it the great book it is. Iâ€™m a long time political junkie and read books about every election as my â€œhabitâ€ù requires. Wolffâ€™s book is the most explosive since the Halperin and Heilemann book Game Change on the 2008 election.Whether you have been depressed since November 2016 or been elated at the election of Donald Trump, you owe it to yourself to read Wolffâ€™s book.",January-5-2018,5
5865,"This book is well written and compelling, the author believable and elequent, and it reads like the horror novel I wish it were. Reading this will give me nightmares, but when I wake up, the nightmares will still be reality. Trump is actually even worse than I believed possible, and I have an excellent imagination. These are dark times indeed. Read this, and know the enemy that we must fight against!",January-5-2018,5
5866,Great insight into the Trump Administration and at the same time very entertaining. I would recommend this book to anyone that cares for and loves America. Wolffâ€™s narrative is compelling and a page turner.,February-3-2018,5
5867,I went into a binge listening mode when this audio book arrived. Highly recommended.,January-11-2018,5
5868,"I think most of us always suspected that Trumpâ€™s White House was a pretty crazy place, but this book basically provides (mostly anecdotal) proof of that. Full of fascinating stories, if nothing else â€œFire and Furyâ€ù is just a damn good read - whether you choose to believe everything or not. And weirdly, I found that knowing more about the â€œbehind the scenes Trumpâ€ù made him more human somehow, more genuine â€” yes, hate to say it, more sympathetic! Canâ€™t believe that this die-hard liberal Democrat is saying that...",January-10-2018,5
5869,Great read and I love reading the failed presidency of failing Donald chump,January-6-2018,5
5870,I enjoyed the pace and the insights. Hard to know for sure what is real and what is conjecture but based on what we've seen from this administration day in and day out none of it sounds like a stretch. The book was clearly rushed (typos abound) and needed some time and editing but I accepted that early on. This is a gossip rag merged with a long form New Yorker article. Very entertaining.,January-11-2018,3
5871,"First I chose 5 stars because according to the book this would absolutely make the President livid.  This book was shocking and eye opening, it also makes me worried for future dealings with other countries.  It was an incredibly fast read for me, mainly because of the shock and disbelief on how the administration is run.  Getting my popcorn ready for the movie and musical.",January-11-2018,5
5872,"300 pages with 50 of content. That being said, if itâ€™s even 1/2 true, this country has sold out to special interests, highest bidders and lowest denominators of common sense.  We seem to be an empire ending... and not ending well.",January-10-2018,3
5873,"Based on first hand insights, the author paints a picture of chaos, infighting, and vindictive media leaks from the White House and a President totally consumed with his image.",January-14-2018,5
5874,It is hard to determine what is true from Fake.  It is sad that our country has come to this daily onslaught of drama from our government.,January-16-2018,3
5875,The subject of this book needs ALL the negativity we can provide to awaken his supporters to his selfish evil!,January-11-2018,5
5876,"While I doubt that every aspect of every story in this book is literally true, I believe it does paint an accurate overall picture of the Trump White House. Just as dabs of paint on a canvas do not literally represent Mona Lisa or a landscape, the paintings likely give you an accurate representation of the subject. Given what we know about Trump from a variety of sources, this book doesn't come across as the equivalent of modern art.",January-17-2018,4
5877,"I didn't want to buy this book. But, you know, I just sort of had to and I was pleasantly surprised. The book is written with language and style indicating the author is a sober grownup and his target audience are grownups as well, not the hungry readers of snarky blogs. Make no mistake, it is eviscerating the Trump image even further but it's doing it in a sublimely cool, rational and, presumably quote-driven way which is hard to put down and is likely to woo some fence sitters. It's a fascinating look at all the players behind the scenes and a bit of pertinent backstory on who they are and what they stand to gain or lose in this Coney Island Side SHow.  Trump orcs themselves won't read it because it's not written like the grade school invective-laden screed that gets their sweat flowing one way or the other.",January-6-2018,5
5878,"I'm only through the first chapter, but I'm dismayed at how many people surrounding Trump all thought it was a joke and that he should never be President, nor given any responsible political voice whatsoever. It's like everybody around Trump just stood around watching a house burn but didn't do anything because they could sell tickets to the fire (Bannon, Flynn, Manafort, or make their names as having witnessed the fire (Conway, Pence, Trump's kids), or literally just wanted to watch the government break for their own benefit (Ailes, McConnell, Murdoch, Ryan). I'll update this as I plow through the Kindle version. It's a heartbreaking read for a patriotic American.",January-5-2018,5
5879,"Anyone who has been following politics the past two years is not going to be surprised by what is written in â€œFire and Furyâ€ù. Confirms what many had thought, Trump had no intention of getting elected. He was building his brand, increasing his base for the new Trump network, without costing him a dime. It is interesting how Michael Wolff gained access to Trump Tower and then the West Wing, being the fly on the wall many of us at one time or another wished we could be. While this book has been pushed to the press because of tRumps threats against The First Amendment, it has a some style and editing issues. Those do not get in the way of what is a well written chronicle of events. We are just days into 2018. Already, itâ€™s heating up. Meanwhile, in Washington, tRump stamps his feet, waves his hands and sputters about stopping the publication. Remember tRumpâ€™s use of the slight of hand. Yells and screams about one thing to distract us from something else. Sure enough, while we have our heads buried in our iPads, Kindles and books, the deceiver in chief is proposing opening up all our coast lines to oil and gas exploration. Gee, no conflict of interest there. Sessions interfering with states rights and more.Read, evaluate for yourself, keep aware and engaged. Vote in November 2018.",January-5-2018,5
5880,"Fire and Fury by Michel Wolff is not the best-written book, nor does Wolff reveal anything that we can't see by observing Trump in any media, whether deemed real or fake news.My first impressions were that Wolff's prose read like an OK true-crime book.  Then I thought, oh wait, it sort of is just that. I am giving the book at least one more star than I would normally because I do not appreciate any feds, especially a high profile and powerful one, issuing a Cease and Desist threat against an author and publisher.  Hello????? Isn't  (or wasn't) the Tea Party line all about the'Federal Government butting out of States' Rights and The  Individual's rights? Like the right to bear arms? and, oh I don't know, like The Freedom of Speech?",January-5-2018,5
5881,"Obviously hastily written, and who knows what is true, half true, or false, it paints a mesmerizing and horrific picture of the Trump Whitehouse. If even 5% of this book is true, our country is in grave danger.",January-11-2018,5
5882,Parts of the book were interesting but for the most part if you had been paying attention to what had been going on for the last few years and done any kind of research then the book was pretty boring. I kept saying to myself maybe the next chapter but that just didn't happen,January-31-2018,3
5883,"Half way through, but total proof of what we all know to be a reality show of a presidency.  I believe that Trump is stupid enough and narcissistic enough to have let Wolff have free reign of the West Wing.  It's like a bad dream.",January-7-2018,5
5884,Reading the Kindle version.  Anything worth trying to legally block is worth reading and knowing. It is sad that there are no surprises. Also to know that the sinking feeling we had in our stomach for the past year was justified.,January-5-2018,5
5885,"Such a well-crafted and highly readable (and highly entertaining) tragi-comedy.  It really is such a good book - it amasses the chaotic flood of information we have heard over the past year into a fun and educational narrative.  We already knew or suspected these things about Trump but have all been so exhausted trying to piece together so much insanity into some coherent story, something we can grab onto and understand better how we ever got to this point in U.S. history.  This book brilliantly crafts all of the flotsam and jetsam of the insanity of Trump and his White House into a narrative that just lets us breathe and be entertained for a while, just for a brief moment before we go back to being horrified and exhausted by Trump's next shenanigans.  I love Wolff's quote on Trump lambasting his book:â€œMy credibility is being questioned by a man who has less credibility than perhaps anyone who has ever walked on earth at this point,â€ù he said.",January-5-2018,5
5886,What a relevant piece of work. Lots of insight.,February-2-2018,5
5887,"A big disappointment. Much more hype about the book, then it actually contained. We know already that Trump is a moron. The book didn't tell us much more. It ""hinted"" a lot, but didn't follow through.",February-4-2018,2
5888,This book is confirmation of what most of us thought of this sham of a president and his staff. Love Wolff's openness to put this out for the world to see. Let's hope the next chapter involves impeachment and removal of the subjects in this book.,January-11-2018,5
5889,"I wasn't going to buy this book, but was able to read several chapters from the Wikileaks link before it was disabled. Now I have to finish it because it really only confirms what is blazingly obvious - there's a hella-crazy amusement park ride going on in the White House.  From only 3 chapters, I can see why Trump wanted to try and stop the publication of this book. If it were really based on nothing but lies, he wouldn't care. But, everything I've read so far just confirms that we already knew this guy and his pack of nutcases are an embarrassment. It's almost hard to believe they're all not really just the cast of characters from a Mel Brooks movie. This book deserves to be the best seller that it already is. The real sad thing is that there are still a large number of his voters/fans who will love him even more after reading this book.",January-8-2018,4
5890,"Fire and Fury does not disappoint. I was skeptical; I thought this might be just a tabloid romp. It is not-it is well written, well sourced, and just plain fascinating. At times it is funny, and at times very sad. I came away from the read, with the sense that almost all of the contents were genuine, and a feeling of dread for our nation; we have elected a man to our highest office, who is small, empty and full of spitting rage.",January-7-2018,5
5891,"I really wanted to like this book, but it is SO hard to read.  Poorly written, and was not edited appropriately.  Words are missing, misspelled, and poor sentence construction is rampant.  In addition, the author rambles on. adding information that could have been left out.  He often gets off track on the subject, which makes it difficult to follow the subject matter.I ended up skipping through the book to chapters I really wanted to see, and left it at that.  All in all, I probably read 2 chapters in their entirety.  In my opinion, they rushed to get it published. regardless of content and errors.",February-7-2018,2
5892,"There are some very interesting in-sites into the Trump presidency and into Trump in particular.  One should, however, take a cautionary note when reading the book.  Author Wolff appears to embellish his work not in favor of the president or his disciples.  One has to question how he gained and ...maintained access to the White House and was not questioned about his purpose for being there.  It is hard to imagine such a thing considering the security involved with protecting the president and the presidency.",January-10-2018,5
5893,"A compelling read...if you already hate Bannon and Trump, this book will give you more reasons to do so.. Wolff must have interviewed dozens and dozens of people and the writing is good enough so that you have to believe he is credible.  I would be happier if I knew who actually said what to him in all the interviews.",January-17-2018,4
5894,"Definitely worth the read, if you can look past the choppy sentences, excessive commas and misspellings. Took a star off for the last two descriptions, but the publisher did rush the book to print, so what can you do? Other than that, this book gives you a pretty blunt look at the factions within the Trump White House all vying for control. Thereâ€™s a saying out there, which fits with our current times and it goes, â€œWhen the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.â€ù (Hunter S. Thompson). If only he were still around to guide us mutants through this odyssey, because the times sure are getting weird.",January-11-2018,4
5895,"I taught a course on the presidency for a more than two decades and would not assign this book in the course.  However, for those who don't like Trump and enjoy gossip this book is fun to read.",March-8-2018,4
5896,The book is a mixture of facts and author imagination.It probably well describes the psyche of Trump but the author seems to pick and choose the facts that prove his foregone conclusions.,January-30-2018,3
5897,"Like many others here, I bought this book primarily because the Mango Mussolini wanted it banned. Nothing really surprising in the book, just confirms what most people have already concluded . . . still, it's definitely worth reading.",January-5-2018,5
5898,Makes me feel like I might be having a stroke when trying to readi Trump quotes.  Would recommend.,January-6-2018,5
5899,The way to get everyone to buy your book is to have the Stable Genius Cheeto attempt to ban it.,January-8-2018,5
5900,"This book reminds me of a Kitty Kelly tell all. There is some ambiguity and no one really is a source, but you know the stories told are true. The writing is accessible and singular, if not good, and the pace and chapters move the reader along. The news has reported much of the book and it feels like it should be juicier, but also feels like it is, a reliable fun read about dysfunction in the White House.",January-15-2018,3
5901,Very interesting....... can't put the book down.  :-),January-24-2018,5
5902,This book is like being a fly on the wall of the Trump White House. Total dysfunction and incompetence on display on a daily basis. Book is well written and should be read by all voters.  This book seems to confirm what other journalists have written about this presidency. This president is not up to the job and the whole republican party is complicit.  I'm sure voters will make them aware of that in November. Pray for our country and our democracy.,January-11-2018,5
5903,"An excellent book that reveals the palace politics and the in-fighting and maneuvering of the factions in Trump's White House. Most of it we already knew, but Wolff pulls it all together into a coherent picture.NOTE THAT THE KINDLE VERSION IS NOT THE COMPLETE VERSION.I have come across a number of references in the press and media to incidents described in the print copy that do not appear in the kindle version.",January-8-2018,5
5904,"Good read. I purposely ordered because of the effort by tRump to censor the book. I just had to go through the Table of Contents and select the chapters most of interest to me. As has been said, ""if even 50% of this material is true..."".",January-5-2018,5
5905,"Look how hard the diseased Republican establishment, wed to a maniac they never wanted, is trying to bury this book.  Thank you, DJT for tweeting your ire about this work, and getting me to read it!  It reeks of truth, and its characterizations of the President fit what we know about him, and his history.  Even if only 50% of what the author uncovers is accurate, this work is a bombshell of truth that shines a light on who this President really is.  A must read for those of us who are sick to our stomachs that this tyrant represents our great nation!  For Trump supporters:  try reading this with an open mind...  you may question your support for this great charlatan!",January-7-2018,5
5906,"As a foreigner not living in the US, I found this book somewhat.... disturbing. Even after reading conservative reviews of the book labeling it extremely liberal and with a leftist agenda, I would not neccessarily agree. It's a recount of stories and events with a personal twist to it. Well, well. It's a quick read, author writes well, but keeps getting repetive after the first half is completed as it turns into a recount of historic events (that as I'm currently reading it just happened mere months ago).",January-31-2018,3
5907,Itâ€™s clear from this book that we have a bunch of clowns running our country. Hopefully there will be no international disasters in the next few years.,February-17-2018,5
5908,"Well made book, the content is yet to be history.",January-31-2018,5
5909,"Wolff is a skilled writer even if he is also an unprincipled reporter. I was entertained, but then I loathed Trump to begin with.",February-2-2018,3
5910,"I usually stick to horror fiction. Trump in the White House has been the non-fiction type of horror that has been just too much. I wasn't going to buy this book. I knew I'd see many of the ""juicy bits"" plastered all over Facebook. But when Trump tried to stop publication? Well, I hate the concept of book banning. So I've forked over my $15 bucks and am glad to be part of the reason for this book's best seller status.",January-5-2018,5
5911,"Well written, and important. Highly recommended.",January-6-2018,5
5912,"It was the first book I ever got on my new Kindle!! Purchased at daybreak Friday when it came out and was done by midday Saturday. I only wanted more!  It cobfirms much of what we see on a daily basis - a man whoâ€™s overprivileged and catered to his entire life - who has no concept of right and wrong; who is wholly unqualified to lead any country least of all America, a light to the world. As clueless as heâ€™s shown to be, I can forgive him because you canâ€™t hold crazy against a person. The groveling psychophantsvwho know better yet continue to enable/use him to try and corrupt our institutions get the brunt of my blame. I think the author is a patriot and did our country a real service by pulling back the curtains so we can really see these Keystone lops and robbers/Three Stooges caliber administration",January-10-2018,5
5913,"Got this yesterday - I thought I'd spent 1 hrs to read before bed. I ended-up staying until 3 AM and forced myself to close the book and sleep.Although I have not finished the book, I can say that this book was well executed and very entertaining.  All of the characters need not an introduction. Wolff dived into the topics immediately. It gave me a glimpse of the Trumpian world that I don't see on TV. I wish it were fictional - unfortunately it is not. Recent Trump's tweets further confirmed the contents of Wolff's discussion in the book. Truly an eye-opening !!",January-6-2018,5
5914,Amazing insight into the world of President Trump. I enjoyed the views of this author and have recommended this book to everyone I know!,January-18-2018,5

5916,Very interesting.,January-11-2018,5
5917,"This carefully crafted, well written book paints a collective image of an organization reminiscent of Caligula. Every citizen and non citizen should read this cautionary tale of what happens when you elect a person without the basic requisite skills. Although it provides hope and trust in our institutions, it illustrates the fragility of our constitution.The errors so often mentioned in the press are relatively minor.I look forward to the sequel.",January-11-2018,5
5918,"Couldnt put it down. For anyone who has been following US politics, its really nothing new other than it presents the known chaotic chapters of this nutjob administration from an insider's perspective.",January-7-2018,5
5919,Awsome. Couldn't put it down.,January-11-2018,5
5920,"This book.... is possibly funnier than any other comedy shows you've watched so far. I'm cracking up main time, and I haven't laughed while reading in a very long time. At the same time, it's sad that this is not a comedy show but a reality of American politics. So glad that I don't have to suck up with some phony who is trying to kick all the immigrants out of the country. I mean, I was legally there, but who knows? he can always kick me out too.",January-6-2018,5
5921,I ordered it on Audible and it is much better than I had anticipated. There's so much information there and not just of the salacious type. It really gives a lot of details about what was going on behind the scenes. I highly recommend this book.,January-7-2018,5
5922,I read this with an open mind and was amazed at how relevant the information was. After observing Donald Trump since 2016 I came to the conclusion this is an accurate book.,January-11-2018,5
5923,Wolff's description of the inside of the Trump administration was exactly as I had imagined it.,January-17-2018,5
5924,Reading this book is like watching a boxing match where you hate both of the boxers and you want the ref to die of a heart attack.  If this book is even 30% true it leaves me with the belief that America has more dark days ahead of it.,January-7-2018,5
5925,Itâ€™s everything that I expected.,January-27-2018,4
5926,"I probably would have been content to read excerpts in the papers and online, but once President Trump tried to stop the book from coming out, my decision was made to purchase the book.  In addition to being fascinating, I find the material credible (and as one who cares about my country, I wish it weren't so).  Meanwhile, my jaw drops to the floor listening to the president claiming he wants to fix libel laws to prevent people from saying things they know to be false...um, perhaps like saying repeatedly that President Obama was not a US Citizen???  His total lack of self-awareness proves the premises of this book.",January-10-2018,5
5927,"It's like looking at a hideous accident, which this presidency really is!  No one, not even Trump, planned on winning this thing (except for Steve Bannon).  I know that Trump-lovers will try to pick holes in this, but everything echoes what we've seen or heard already.  In fact, I considered not buying it because I got snippet from the news, etc., and thought that would be enough.  But when I heard Trump tried to quash the release of this book, I decided to buy it and help it become a top seller.  I'm glad I did (despite the queasiness it causes) because there is so much more and it puts into clear view and context the truth of the my uneasiness and fears.",January-8-2018,5

5934,"This is actually a good book, it puts the whole picture together about what we heard in the media and the denials by Trump on certain things and now, getting the information from his staffers, a lot of stuff we heard from the media fits right in.  No wonder Trump doesn't want anyone reading this book, this is Yugely embarrassing and make him look like a big fool.",January-5-2018,5

5944,"Everything Wolfe says should be taken with a grain of salt.  Much of what he reports is a rehash of what you already know. Trump will continue on until maybe Mueller can put together a case that will damn Trump. Perhaps Bannon will continue to be the real power behind the Trump presidency, even though he is now out of the White House and now out of Breitbart too.  Wolfe is the fly on the White House wall whose credibility will only be proven by events that will occur after time period of this book.  Time will tell.",January-18-2018,3

Itâ€™s like reading a vampire series with Team Jarvanka on one side and Team Bannon the other.  Riveting yet scary since this is real and a threat to the USA and the world.",January-11-2018,5
5948,Just bought the book on kindle. And then found out that the free pdf version (probably pirated) is widely circulated in China and the emerging markets.

5950,"It was fascinating reading about the machinery of the election and first presidential year from Wolff's point of view.

5953,"I had expected the book to be anti-trump, but hoped it would be about how he picked his people and their interactions with each other. I was pleased to see it was the latter. It was more anti-Bannon. Wolff writes like Trump talks so he seems to jump all over the place. There is nothing surprising about what he writes. I suspect if Trump actually read it he probably would not have been upset about how he was represented.",January-16-2018,5

5957,"The Trump presidency is unfortunate at best. This book reads like a trashy novel, but the tragedy is a real dishonest president and his incompetent cohorts with a Congress lacking leadership.It is a must read book, in my opinion, but leads one to want to take a bath afterwards - and to be realistically afraid for our country.",January-17-2018,4

As if we need any more proof that our Idiot in Chief is patently unqualified for the job he obtained and might also be mentally unstable. And this is another reminder that Republicans could put an end to this any time they want, the evidence is overwhelming, but they care more about tax cuts for the rich instead of saving our republic.I bought this book for a few reasons:1. To support great journalism.2. To irritate Trump and his sycophantic followers by keeping this book on the best seller list.",January-5-2018,5

Buy this book, for we must all support the kind of journalism that exposes the truth about a racist, corrupt, and dysfunctional presidency, and we must also support the right to publish the truth.",January-11-2018,5
5972,"Bravo to Mr. Wolff for so effectively exposing the incompetent, indecent, ignorant, crude, immature and breathtakingly dysfunctional presidency of Mr. Trump.Several stories in the book paint a personal picture of Trump as a uniquely immoral, almost entirely horrible human being.",January-5-2018,5

5974,"Not really sure how to rate this. The low rating is not about the politics - Trump and his supporters are repulsive monsters, beneath contempt, who should be jailed - but rather the rushed quality of the manuscript. It's repetitive and does not offer much that wasn't in the excerpt. Yet this is still a hugely influential book that I'd consider essential reading. If any of us live long enough to look back on this travesty as history, this will be an important document. Yet rushing it to press diminished the prose.",January-11-2018,3
5975,The narrative in this book is affirmation of what has been perceived as an ignorant narcissist who is more worried about being liked than the overall welfare of this great nation. How and why individuals continue to support this man is beyond common sense. I for one am in fear of the unpredictable damage he may cause this nation. It is clear a r f2f hat he has no clue of what being president means and the extent of which he is damaging our standing in the world.,January-11-2018,4
5976,"This book is a mirror into the sad decline of American life. 2016 gave us a choice between two criminals, both of whom will likely be in jail in a year, while voters put a man who can't read and grabs women in the worst spot into office. This same man installed an Amway billionaire who never went to public school to run our entire country's school system. He insults every one around him, he is proud of a tax bill that will add 5 trillion to the debt by the time he leaves in disgrace. This book confirms what everyone knows, the emperor has no clothes!",January-9-2018,5
5977,"Entertaining and hard to put down.  We've wondered what was going on and this is illuminating.  Only criticism is it is not completely in chronological order, which is occasionally confusing.",January-7-2018,5
5978,"I bought this book because it was new and I thought the media would be referring to it endlessly. I did not enjoy it, partially because the author refers to facts I am not familiar with bit does  not explain them, and because he has no new information about Donald Trump. Rather disappointed.",January-11-2018,4
5979,Whoo who! Great book - very readable.,January-16-2018,5
5980,"The author of this book needs to learn how to write. It is loaded with run-on sentences, bad grammar and difficult to read context. It's written like we are all Washington, D.C. insiders that have been privy to the inner workings of the Trump Whitehouse. There are juicy tidbits throughout but it's so hard to read, I can't make it through a whole chapter at a time. It will be on the best seller list only because of the promised context.Having said that, we are told over and over that he doesn't understand politics, his eyes glaze over during security briefings, he just wants to be liked, his daughter and son-in-law are acting more like New York Democrats than Washington Republicans, he airs his feelings about everyone in D.C. to his friends on the phone every night, he talks too much and never listens to anyone else, he can't handle any type of criticism, he has no idea what he is doing, he never expected to win and was just running to push the Trump brand name, and well, you get the drift. If ten percent of the content is true, the swamp will not be drained anytime soon. As citizens of our nation, we need to stay focused on what is going on in politics, question our elected officials whenever we know something is not right and be more involved. I have actually started writing letters to the elected officials in my state. It will be interesting to see what the responses are, if any.One more thing, when I saw this book being talked about on the news, I understood it to be a Steve Bannon and Michael Wolff co-creation, at least that was the way it was being presented. Steve Bannon is just one of the many characters being talked about and not a co-author. Believe me, Steve Bannon is one small piece of a very strange, out-of-control hot mess, according to Michael Wolff. I am a third of the way through the book and I don't get the fire and fury thing. Who has fire? Who has fury? Everyone? No one? I am sorry I bought this thing because the end result is, it's hard to read and poorly written, I can't make it through a whole chapter in one sitting, I would have to subscribe and read daily all of the major east coast newspapers (to be able to get all the ""insider"" references and hints), and the subject matter is repetitive, sometimes scary and sometimes boring. Buy it if you must but I suggest you wait for your local library to get it and check it out from them.",February-7-2018,2

5984,"I mainly purchased this book because our Dictator in Chief tried to suppress our first amendment rights by banning it.  Then, I started reading it.  It's far from fantasy and does a great job of painting a picture of Trump and the people around him.  The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 was the constant fractured sentences, paragraph long sentences, and the unnecessary over use of AP English words that most will not comprehend.  I fear the extreme flowery language will turn off the very reader that NEEDS to read this book.  You know who you are: The Trump Base.",January-6-2018,4
5985,"Wolff provides insight and clarity into the mental illness of this president. ""Fire and Fury"" helps a now-weary American populace better understand what motivates Trump's tweets and diatribes. There's a certain solace that comes from the book, to finally have some understanding as we watch the train-wreck that is the Trump presidency.",January-6-2018,5
5986,"A look at the people surrounding Presidential candidate Donald J. Trump after he inexplicably wins the election, what they think of the man that they hitched their careers and reputations to., and the infighting between the factions in the White House: Bannonites, Jarvankas, and the few sane and sober professionals struggling to keep the place from imploding.Thanks to provocative excerpts shared on cable news programs and a poorly thought out Cease and Desist letter from Trump's attorney to both the networks as well as to the author and publisher, the book's publication date was moved up from Tuesday to Friday and it shot to the pre-order bestseller list.QUOTE:  ""[Trump] was what he was.  Twinkle in his eye, larceny in his soul.""The author appears to have had access primarily to Stephen Bannon, although based on other direct quotes used, others in the White House were either interviewed or overheard.  Yes, this is an anti-Trump book, but it also spreads the responsibilities for where this country currently is perched to those who either support or enable Trump as well as scrutinizing the media for their coverage.  But it is also clear that much of that is due to Trump's own actions, reactions, and verbal diarrhea on both Twitter and to reporters he considers supporters and friends.QUOTE:  ""Here was another peculiar Trump attribute: an inability to see his actions the way most others saw them.""Much of what is in the book rings true, based on past public interviews and on-air commentary by those who either were or still are advocates.  I am not saying that it is 100% accurate.  Even I can see the author's bias.  I do think it deserves a critical read by both pro- and anti-Trump readers.  Big warning, at least for the Kindle version, there are quite a few typos.  Some are humorous, such as ""pubic"" instead of ""public"".  However, as a former proofreader and still active grammar cop, I found it annoying.  4 out of 5.",January-17-2018,4

The ""wannabe first female president "" and her creepy husband are quite well aware of both families illegal financial histories. Their panic at possible exposure is a pleasure to see.

It did answer some questions for me, including why non family members were willing to take cabinet positions (short answer: they were either plucked from obscurity by Trump and therefore rose and fell with him, or were career politicians who thought they could do some good by containing the disaster). It also explained some of the more mind boggling things that occurred over the past 18 months, and confirmed that even those who work for him share the same perceptions as 65% of the population.

Very few direct quotes; lots of assuming peopleâ€™s motivations and assigning people to ever shifting factions.

6039,"Donald Trump is a disgrace to our country. However, this book was written like it was the diary of a high school student. Most educated people are desperate to get rid of Trump. This book is little more than a temporary cathartic to make them feel better.",April-20-2018,2
6040,Things I already knew.  Still learned a lot! Recommend reading for all who want to know whatâ€™s going on now !!,January-15-2018,4
6041,"For those who have suspicions of Trumpâ€™s narcissism, mental instability, delusional self-aggrandizement, and flagrant disregard and/or ignorance of the Constitution and governing in general, this book will not only confirm his unfitness to be President, it will fill in some blanks that leave most people flabbergasted as to how such an intolerable person can continue to be tolerated. Wolff has a gift for making the reader feel like theyâ€™re involved in a riveting tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, and the anecdotes related are all the more interesting for their relevancy to the current urgent situation into which Trump and all his enablers have plunged the country. Glad I bought the book, gladder still when this shamefully inadequate, so-called President will be nothing more than an embarrassing  footnote in history.",January-6-2018,5

6046,"Like others, I wasn't going to buy this book, but after hearing that the president of the United States of America SUED to stop its publication, I became interested.Frankly, I am so weary of this guys antics, one of my new year's resolutions was to stop watching the administration's trainwreck of a journey. At least for a while until I can find a better coping mechanism, because it is starting to make me feel crazy. But on hearing that he ponied up the lawyers to stop us from reading it, I purchased both the hardcover, and the kindle version.I've read a bit, and so far, I find it both shocks me, and simultaneously, is no surprise at all. It is what I expected to see, what I feared to read. I had held out an optimistic hope that it couldn't be as bad as I feared. huh.just buy it!",January-5-2018,5
6047,Well written.  Yes there are some edits that were missed but they don't even begin to take away from the message you will receive from the majority of this book's pages.,January-18-2018,5

6049,It was like cutting through a mile of brush to find a small coin.  Could have been a much shorter book.  Waste of money.,February-10-2018,3

6052,"Mr Wolff paints a picture of a White House in complete disarray, why and how it got that way, and how completely incapable it will be for it to recover.  Indirectly he demonstrates the value of the bureaucracy as stalwart defenders of our Democracy and the real value of professionals who man these institutions.  You can't make this sh*t up!",January-11-2018,5
6053,Loved every sentence.  Loved Mr. Wolf's writing style too.,January-17-2018,5

6057,It was an easy read.  Generally I knew it was a chaotic WH. The book just confirmed it by filling in the details. Itâ€™s important that citizens are made aware of whatâ€™s happening. It is not â€œfake news.â€ù,January-11-2018,4

6064,"This book explains what anyone watching from the outside must have suspected. Trump's campaign was a publicity stunt. He never expected to win. And once in office, his natural sense of entitlement drove him. Artful and engaging style. Must read.",January-11-2018,5
6065,"While itâ€™s no literary masterpiece, yet itâ€™s not as poorly written as some people have said it to be. Iâ€™ll highly recommend reading it to anyone interested in the inner workings of the Trump administration (despite the bits and pieces from the book that you might have read or heard of in various media outlets).",February-18-2018,4

6072,"First of all, it's a hugely entertaining read, laugh ( or wince ) out loud at times. Everyone has seen the excerpts of course but the book has much more depth. I found it nuanced and not entirely negative regarding Trump. I'm no fan of his but I now have a deeper understanding of his strengths.Some of the scenes and conversations may or may not be fully sourced but the overall portrait of the principal actors rings true from everything we already know of them.Highly recommend!",January-10-2018,5
6073,"This is a page turner. I donâ€™t  think there are any real surprises in  here, other than the Trump WH is way more chaotic than I imagined. Good read!",January-17-2018,5

6075,The best way to get people to buy this book is the president saying not to buy this book. Itâ€™s a great read as well.,January-6-2018,5
6076,"Clearly this book is biassed, but I don't doubt it's authenticity.  With so many direct quotes and attributions the author would be begging for a libal lawsuit were he not confident in his sources and in possession of hard facts to back up the quotes.  It's said he was not bound by non-disclosure agreements and often recorded his conversations.If this were fiction it would be classified as a black comedy.  It's not so funny - terrifying in fact - to realize that this isn't fiction and isn't a book that can be dismissed as ""fake news"".",January-6-2018,5
6077,I found the person narrating very boring and somewhat monotone which detracted from the book,February-3-2018,3
6078,"This book, while interesting in parts, was really told from the point of view of Steve Bannon, Trump's former senior advisor. Still, it only touches on the ideological leanings of Bannon and almost seems to paint him as a tragic character. Mind you - Steve Bannon is quite the disgusting, opportunistic, nationalist who had absolutely no business advising any government official. On the other hand, Wolff had no trouble painting the other characters - ""Jarvanka,"" Hicks, Priebus, etc. - as completely incompetent.After the initial excitement of reading a book so controversial and hyped by the press, I found this to be an utter slog. I only finished it because I'm not a quitter (lol). Maybe I just find this stuff - contemporary politics - more depressing than interesting.",January-14-2018,2
6079,"This book focuses on the chaos that is occurring inside the Whitehouse that is displayed everyday, but putting it in the perspective of those involved confirmed what we know to be our country's truth.",January-15-2018,4
6080,"Whether or not you like Steve Bannonâ€™s policies or personality, Fire and Fury shows that aside from Reince Preibus he was the only one in Trumpâ€™s West Wing who had a clue about politics.This may be the reason Trump wanted the book banned, while he missed the fact that it reveals no damning evidence of his direct involvement with the campaign collusion with Russia.A good reminder of many forgotten episodes during the Trump Presidency saga.",January-11-2018,4
6081,"always said, truth is stranger and more entertaining then ""fake"". Well done.  White House=Twilight Zone.  Can't wait for the movie!",January-7-2018,5
6082,"The book is interesting and insightful, but feels a little sloppy, which puts the truth of it all in question. In general, it seems accurate, as it provides solid rationale to every strange and notable event of Trumpâ€™s first year.",January-16-2018,3
6083,If only a small part of this is true it's worth your time.  This confirms my worst fears about Trumps' lack of character.  One thought I come away with is that those who support the childish emperor with no clothes may be grievouly unpatriotic.  Shame on those in the White House privy to this dangerous nonsense who don't blow the whistle.  They should be running down Pennsylvania Avenue blowing a bugle.,January-9-2018,5
6084,"This is a must-read for anyone following the current mess of American politics and governance. We are facing a clesr crisis with this administration and this book does a great job describing how this has occurred. Wolff delves into not just the specifics but also some helpful speculation of what makes each player tick. Itâ€™s helpful insight that should be taken as exactly that at times, but also a lot of specifics around events and actions.",January-7-2018,5
6085,Page turner,January-11-2018,5
6086,"I actually had low expectations of the writing but to be honest, itâ€™s an engrossing read, well written and pretty credible. If anything, it confirms what too many people have known for too long. Many of the best tidbits were published in the press, but there are still a lot of things that are shocking and disturbing. I read this in two days and couldnâ€™t put it down.",January-7-2018,5

6088,Seems logical,January-13-2018,4
6089,Outstanding!,February-3-2018,5
6090,This book pretty much verified what most of us already knew.  Trump is a whiny little baby with no experience and lacks skill and the requirements for any job at his age.  Especially given his deteriorating mental condition.,January-10-2018,4
6091,A good and interesting read; got interesting information re inside of White House.,April-23-2018,4
6092,"While the Trumpers like to accuse liberals as arrogant, the arrogance of WH staffers with literally no political experience is painted in vivid color for all to see. While all quotes might not be accurate, most quotes are from Bannon who has not denied them. Some quotes have been taken out of context by the press in an attempt to quickly share the most salacious details. It is clear Bannon is fighting for the racist or racialist agenda Trump pushed during the campaign. He wants the world and the US to go back to 1955 to 1965 when the. World was great to him and Trump, So  instead of this administration wanting to move this country forward, it is about moving the country back to the time when I guess â€œwhite menâ€ù were more comfortable with their ultimate  position in society. This book exposes the philosophy and actions of Trumpism that prefers ugly American brawn over brains, science and strategy. A White House led by a man who is uncouth,paranoid, autocratic, self-absorbed and  only concerned about being  a â€œstar,â€ù  This Book describes what we all know from day to day reporting of WH actions and the often juvenile Presidential tweets.  Despite what Trumpers say, the essence of this Book rings true and we have a government not trying to make us great again but to quickly as possible destroy the time- honored institutions of the government. It confirms my personal view that the Trumo Administration is about the rise of the 4th Reich. The book is a harbinger of things to come or continue as we as Anericabs focus on the sounds  and cymbals of the Trump  fire and  fury instead of its actual damage being done to the USA by an incompetent WH.",January-7-2018,5

6097,Had to buy it just because he tried to have it censored.  We don't do that in 'Merica!,January-5-2018,5
6098,"It is what it is. A gossipy collection of materials which will be hair raising and fire breathing truth for the people who don't like the administration and called a pack of lies by the people who do. Myself, I think it's probably 40% accurate with a flair for the dramatic to keep it interesting.",January-11-2018,3
6099,"Frightening book filled with insider information we would rather not know. This is a book that will be remembered. It shows what is going on in  the White House.I only gave it four stars because I can't bring myself to give it five. It's too horrifying for words. There are a couple of mistakes three fact checkers should have caught. And there are some spelling oddities in the Kindle version that are sloppy.Some will deny it's veracity, which is too bad. But Trump's true believers won't buy a word of it. They can't accept the facts that are right in front of them. The rest of us are stuck between a rock and a hard place.But this book will put another nail in the coffin that holds the current administration. The case being built against it gets stronger every day.",January-11-2018,4
6100,"The federal American government consists of three tiers: Congress, the Supreme Court, and the White House administration.  The three function like a tripod upholding the ""united"" part of the United States. If one fails  the other two might not be able to maintain the federation of the States, rendering the Constitution irrelevant. The 50 States will become an association of States, falling back on their respective State constitutions, thereby protecting their pertinent ethnic and historical practices free of federal meddling. It is the decline and fall of the American Empire....",January-11-2018,5

6102,"Like several million people, I don't like the idea of some rich, spoiled, crooked politician saying what I should not be allowed to read.  But, actually, even before the effort to suppress came out, I had heard enough to place this book on my must read list.Like most people who have been following the news, I knew that the infighting in the Trump White House was vicious enough to make the Night of the Long Knives look like the meeting of a mutual admiration society.  This was my chance to get some idea of who was allied with who against whom, and that is just what I found.Have you ever heard someone say, ""I'd like to be a fly on the wall in that room.""?  It turns out that there was, for a while, a literal fly on the White House wall, and this is the book he wrote.You have probably heard quite a few of the outrageous quotes from the book, but this is not just a book of sound bites.  It is a serious, in depth description of who did what to who in which room with what.  Overriding it all is the attempt by three gangs of incompetent bunglers to try to hold a spoiled, lazy, child-man's attention on the business of running a government for even a half hour at a time.The book is engrossing and well written.  Once I started reading, I could not put it down.  I have to admit that everything I read was filtered through my loathing for Donald Trump and my disgust for the nest of sycophants with which he has surrounded himself.  This book has done nothing to change my mind.",January-6-2018,5
6103,"I haven't read it yet, I really bought it because Trump tried to stop it from being sold.",January-5-2018,5
6104,"A ""Must Read"".Well written and smooth reading. Cannot say I was surprised at 80% of the disclosures and the remainder is unfortunately only too believable. The scary thing to me is that these are the people who are holding my life, my future and that of my loved ones in their hands. Will highly recommend this book to all. It does not matter if you voted for one or the other candidate, that is the past, it should matter what the future holds if this is indicative of the here and now.",January-6-2018,5
6105,"â€œAnd he donâ€™t know a thing about musicâ€ù or anything else, for that matter. Already 1/3 of the way through it and one thing keeps running through my mind: the headline that appeared on the front page of the London newspaper, the Mirror, when they re-elected Bush II, â€œ""How can 59,054,087 people be so DUMB?"" Easy, obviously, because 62,979,636 dummies voted for this guy. Itâ€™s not just a tell-all about something weâ€™ve all guessed. Itâ€™s also a sad commentary about the death of political leadership and statesmanship in America - and a very sad indictment of us and just how dumbed-down and selfish weâ€™ve become as a people.",January-5-2018,5
6106,It is frightening to see this as a factual account of the Trump white house. The Machiavellian competition for control by the different internal factions is quite amazing. John Grisham would be hard pressed to write a story line with more political intrigue.,January-10-2018,5

6108,I knew everything that was going on in the book.  No surprises.  Also I was wondering how the author could read Trumps mind and know what he was thinking.  Mr. Wolf did not have enough to back up his knowledge of all he suggested people were doing.  Disappointed.,February-21-2018,1
6109,"Good read. I cannot give it five stars, because I suspect Wolff relied too heavily on Bannon, but it otherwise rings true. Trump's tweets post-release... asserting he is a ""stable genius"" and ""like, smart""... lend credibility to this portrait of an addled, solipsistic President.",January-7-2018,4

6112,"Ever since trump arrived on the political scene, anyone who knew him, or knew of him, dismissed him as a conman. A tribute to P.T.

6113,This is an interesting read and got my attention.  I found several typos in the text and even incomplete sentences.  This book seems rushed to print. If there was not time to correct typos and errors I highly doubt it was fact checked.,February-1-2018,3
6114,"This review is for the Kindle edition and does contain some spoilers, but unless youâ€™ve been living under a rock youâ€™ve probably heard of most of them already. Because the Trump White House lawyers tried to block the publication of this book it immediately became a best seller and was rushed to publication. The author appropriately expressed his gratitude for the publicity. Because of the rush, there are some minor editing errors and typos but they donâ€™t really detract from the overall quality of the book. The main premise is that Candidate Trump ran primarily to increase the value of his â€œbrandâ€ù and hoped to capitalize off of losing to â€œCrooked Hillary.â€ù When he won, his team was ill-prepared and in-fighting between warring factions inside the White House resulted in chaos. Anyone reading the news knew about the chaos, of course, but reading the details was interesting. The interplay between the various personalities is discussed as well as their implications to the investigations.  While I do think it should be read with more than a â€œgrain of salt,â€ù I enjoyed it and have recommended it to my husband, numerous family members and friends.",January-6-2018,4

6119,"This rings true enough, and it is sad in multiple ways. Obviously we have a leader who is barely competent, and off-the-scales atypical; an extreme reaction to the career politicians seemingly acting on automatic the past few decades. I rarely feel much sympathy for Trump, but reading this I had surprising empathy. Who would ever run for public office with todayâ€™s level of surveillance and scrutiny? This book is a valuable snapshot of our times, in more ways than one.",January-11-2018,5
6120,I spent way too much time looking up the meaning of the fifty-cent words that were used throughout the book. They added no value to the text; they just slowed down the flow.,January-24-2018,3

First of all, the author is a great reader...not every author can read their book with a great voice, great inflection, and humor when appropriate. Loved the book,and it lined up with everything that has been said about the chaos and danger in the White House since day one of tRump's term. He was exactly the same on the campaign trail, and his whole life of dysfunction.....I don't know why anyone is surprised about the book. But the world is still surprised that he would be elected (with some help from his Russian friends).  I don't think I would have enjoyed reading the book as much as listening to it...highly recommend the Audible.com version.",January-6-2018,5

6133,"Thanks to the other reviewers for helping me rationalize buying this book- for freedom of the press and a signal to the White House that another voter disapproves of the President. Now to reading it....Easy to read because of all the critiques, itâ€™s biased and opinionated (I admit to sharing that bias.) it is not a scholarly work which does back the idea that it is fake news.

If you have been following the Trump administration, this book will explain WHY he has done some of the things he has done in the past year. None of this is a surprise. The book is a must read if you have been riveted by what is going on in American politics. Honestly, if you are an American you should read this book... It is Ironic that Trump used to say the rest of the world is laughing at us when Obama was president...HA!! Let me clarify..  I am an INDEPENDENT, not a Democrat and I hate things about the extreme left and the extreme right. I have felt from the start that Trump was not qualified to be President and definitely did not have the temperament for the job, BUT I hoped and prayed I was wrong and wanted Trump to succeed because that means success for America. The man is unfit, I truly believe that and this book will tell you all about it",January-8-2018,5

6139,Thought it would have more detail instead of most of stuff we have already heard on the news.  I did not VOTE for him and hope this book is evidence in writing to get him out of White House.,January-23-2018,3

6144,"While the information contained in the book validates my impression of what is going on in the White House, the author is not an eloquent writer. If you can get past that, I recommend it.",January-10-2018,4
6145,This is everything  the public suspected. The truth is within these pages. Trump will do everything in his power to discredit but too many truths are recorded. This book sums up this whole  irrational administration nicely.,January-7-2018,5
6146,"First, my declarations: I am an Independent who tends toward conservative views. I am not a Trump supporter. In fact, I am so regularly embarrassed by him that I sometimes forgo watching the news.I thought I would enjoy the book, but this author's writing style is so off-putting and exasperating that I was unable to finish reading it. He is so clearly full of himself and seems to be spending so much time trying to show how intelligent he is that he forgets that the goal of writing a book like this is to communicate information to people, not tout your own inflated sense of intellect. I have a graduate degree and I found myself using a dictionary to look up the obscure words he was using.  They didn't add to his message; they detracted from it.To make matters worse, the editing was also really, really bad. If I recall correctly, there was one ""paragraph"" that was about 7-10 lines long that was really one giant run on sentence. The inflated writing style, coupled with the bad editing, made this a laborious, unenjoyable read. I had such high hopes...",February-24-2018,1
6147,Although at first it seemed a rehash of much we already know or suspect  the insight grew especially with respect to Bannon and WH inside power struggles.,January-12-2018,4
6148,"Reading this book is like watching a giant pileup on a highway...  One by one cars get smashed into each other, everything is in flames but you can't look away.  Then a school bus... Then an airplane...  Then a giant cruise ship but you don't even think, ""it's a highway, how the ship got here, it's nuts!"", you just can't look away.I wish the author would make it easier to understand, which stories were directly witnessed by the people who the author interviewed himself and which ones are the ones they heard have happened.  On the other hand, I don't hear many people who talked to the author saying ""I never told him that"" so we just have to draw our own conclusions.  To me this book just provided more details that we already new about and what was in the news for several years now, so I have very little reason to doubt it most of it.Interesting read but quite tiring.",January-17-2018,5
6149,This book is extremely well written. It's a very unpleasant and disturbing story. A True story. Thank you Michael Wolf. We need to be informed about what is happening in the White House.,January-11-2018,5

6151,"Most of what I read I knew already from the news programs. I was glad to find most of the content true. I was not surprised by the role of Steve Bannon in almost everything in the White House. There were some typos in what I read, too.",January-11-2018,4
6152,"Although there are glaring inaccuracies (incorrect positions for example) and sloppy editing, the depiction of a fractured WH in the early days seems to reflect what has previously been reported. Probably too alarming regarding POTUS' mental capacity, but not far off on qualified for the job. Glad I read it.",January-11-2018,4
6153,"Well written and full of detail, this is more documentary than tell-all. Michael Wolff's attention to detail, as well as in-depth analysis of the personalities surrounding President Trump, make for an engrossing read.",January-26-2018,5
6154,"Excellent! Trump exposed is frightening, like a slow motion train wreck.",January-5-2018,5
6155,Is anyone really surprised?  The WH and commentators do a poor job convincing us that this is fake and frankly the WH proves this daily with their actions. Ha. Read the poor reviews. They are ridiculous. Sad. Fake. Clearly written by Trumper trolls.,January-5-2018,5

6159,"Wonderful way to read all the things that have happened in the last year. Most of them were highlighted in the news, but having them all in one book made it  really exciting. I couldn't put the book down.  Everyone should read it.",January-6-2018,5
6160,"In the upside reality we are living in, this book unravels the fragile tapestry of the veneer of Trumps White House. A must read for all who care.",January-21-2018,5
6161,I haven't read it but for a hard cover book it looks really cheaply printed and there typos like no one edited the thing which undermines the veracity of the claims in the book.  its nice on my coffee table,April-23-2018,3
6162,"mediocre writing, fascinating subject",January-29-2018,3
6163,No wonder the WH hasn't been specific about anything that's allegedly false: Every word rings true.  And besides it's a really enjoyable read with tongue firmly in cheek. I read a lot of politics and history and for me this is the best book of the decade.,January-11-2018,5
6164,"I cannot believe how much I enjoyed this book. A total insiders look at the current White House. Sometimes jaw dropping, but always interesting, I highly recommend this book.",January-11-2018,5
6165,Terrifying and amusing description of Trump administration.  This is what happens when you lock a group of predators in the same small cage; they take turns preying on each other.  They don't appear to be interested in working for the people who elected them just in in promoting their own agendas.,January-11-2018,4
6166,"I bought this just because I can, and no one, not even Trump, can say I can't read it. I haven't read it yet but I will. And I recommend every American do so too. No book banning allowed.",January-12-2018,5
6167,"Overall, it's an enjoyable read.  You question how the author gets these quotes he provides, but based on the information that President Trump tweets and is reported in all aspects of the media, these accusations are true.  Book is not without it's problems, but would recommend it to anyone.",January-10-2018,4
6168,Very good book. Makes one really wonder !,January-10-2018,5

6173,Great book!! Thank you to the author for his willingness to tell the truth and stand up against the WH! #resistance,January-20-2018,5
6174,This book needs better editing sometimes the words and punctuation are wrong and misspelled. The stories support the things that have already been brought to light only offering support for them. Interesting read but this book is more about Mr. Bannon than Mr. Trump.,January-23-2018,3
6175,Fascinating and explains a lot about the state of the presidency.,January-15-2018,5
6176,Awesome read!  Just handle the truth.,January-24-2018,5
6177,"Deep within the government lies a twisting, turning soap opera. Multiple characters with complex agendas in a compressed timeline can cause confusion. I considered making a flow chart to sort it out. Having watched this as it happened I was able to keep most of it sorted, though flipping pages back and forth was sometimes needed. I am glad the president was not able to stop publication and that it is available to the world. With some revision this could be a great look into an era for future historians and researchers.",January-26-2018,3
6178,Interesting book. Worth the read.,February-16-2018,5
6179,"Could not put this book down! I thought I knew everything about Trump but I had NO IDEA what was really going on inside this current administration, until NOW!",January-5-2018,5
6180,"I thought this was an engrossing albeit, disturbing read. The caution is to avoid taking everything as literal fact. I tired to read this with the same mindset I use when watching an historical recreation -- I know certain things are facts and the rest is observation, assumption, opinion and conjecture.",January-29-2018,5
6181,A fast read. its like a thriller.,January-25-2018,5
6182,"I leave this book not exactly sure where the truth lies in some of these stories but convinced that the author would not have presented the evidence as he did, and would not have arrived at his conclusions about the Trump White House administration and Trump on the prowl, if he had not been riding close enough to the truth throughout.  (The author Wolff explains that some stories contradict others and that phenomenon in itself is symptomatic of the Trump White House and it's infidelity to the truth and propensity for delusion; the author has done the best he can with the stories presented to him.)The other insight I have to offer is this:  As I noted, the authorâ€™s offerings have an overall ring of truth to them.  Any reader who has been paying attention will have â€˜ah-ha!â€™ moments that say â€˜I suspected this is what was going on while Trump has played at being leader of the free world.â€™  Any American capable of seeing through the glass clearly knows intuitively and objectively that Donald Trump is not cut out for the work at hand.I consider the author Wolf a patriot who could not have made all of this up; the truth has to matter more than Donald Trump's show.  For corroboration of truths we look to Trump as we have known him.  His latest antic with the derisive Tweet taunting North Koreaâ€™s leader plus thousands of more samplings of his behavior, available and known to us, offer proof that Wolf portrays Trump as he is.  We are in danger plenty.  Surely America will no longer be first.  Let us pray our democratic republic survives, that democracy survives as a force for good in the world, and the world is not drawn into a war because Trump was allowed to remain in the lead in spite of what we know about him.  He should not have presidential powers.  We must get him out of office before it is too late.",January-5-2018,5
6183,Interesting book. Most of the highlights in the book I already saw on tv or read online but I had to purchase it to do nothing more then piss off the orange idiot in the white house,April-22-2018,4

6191,"As others have said, not much in this book is surprising if you are reading or watching the news. But itâ€™s a real page turner - well written, funny and not particularly partisan. Wolff takes shots at people across the political spectrum, especially in the MSM media as Trump would say.",January-11-2018,5

6193,Interesting book.,April-24-2018,5

6199,"Hard to read but still entertaining. Did not learn more about the overall shortcomings of the Trump White House but, rather, more details of the political chaos underlying them.",January-11-2018,3
6200,loved it!What fun to read about a situation that is currently unfolding.,January-11-2018,5
6201,"Wolff nails it.  Every word rings true.  He has a slightly humerous way of writing also, which makes this horror story fun to read.",January-11-2018,5

6209,"This book is not very well written, and not worth all the hype. If you follow the news, even just the head lines, you don't need to pick up this book. Seems made up in places to fill in some drama.",January-25-2018,2
6210,"The narrative of this book is all too damning of our current POTUS.  I don't want to give anything away for those who have not read it.  But the tomb by Michael Wolfe is informative, entertaining and generally a fun read.  Due to my prurient curiosity I have been following the news of Trump since he announced his presidency.  So some of the contents of 'Fire and Fury' I already know, but other passages left me stunned, amazed and wondering if this is all just a bad dream and when will I wake up?",February-1-2018,5
6211,"While this book is not the most well crafted read, it certainly brought detail to the chaos of the Trump news we hear in the media. If half of what is written is true, we should all be very afraid.",January-11-2018,5

6213,Good read,April-23-2018,5

6216,"Palace intrigue lacking intelligence. Image building at the cost of integrity. This book opens a window on a man absolutely incapable of organizing anything, who has no business being president. Every citizen should read this.",January-6-2018,5
6217,Great reading.,February-18-2018,5
6218,I couldnâ€™t stop reading this book. Wolfeâ€™s  voice is easy to read and his inside take on what was going on incredible to digest. Very glad i got my copy,January-11-2018,5
6219,Anyone who follows politics will find nothing new. Its all a rehash of history to the day Bannon was fired from the Trump administration. It also has the appearancs of being rushed to publication rambling at times with no end to the thought at hand.,February-4-2018,2
6220,"I don't know how much of the book is factual vs supposition and assumption but was saddened at how it illustrates the shambles we seem to find ourselves in.  I think we have lost our way - we aren't seeing the resurgence of America the great, but rather America the great joke. Regardless of whether the book is based on facts or is just one long recap of the worst of this presidency with some theatrical narrative thrown in for effect, it gives form and shape to the widening divide in our country - and hints at a brewing chaos and instability that leaves us vulnerable. No matter your political affiliation, as a country the call to unite should be loud and clear before we implode in a shower of media flamed division. No matter who you are, read it and then reach out to someone from the other side and vow to find a way to stand together on important issues before it's too late. Don't get so caught up in watching the crash that you neglect to put the brakes on and prevent it.",January-6-2018,3
6221,"This book is a REAL behind-the scenes look at Whitehouse filled with inept, government-inexperienced people, each anxious to grab his/her slice of the pie and their ""15-inutes of fame."" The promise to ""drain the swamp"" became a race to erase all vestiges of not only the previous administration, button  government protocol and detente that had been in place for, in many case, decades. The author offers a fly-on-the-wall look at reactions by actual players in the game of ""Who can wield the most power."" Bannon vs.""Jarvanka"" and Priebus struggling to attach some sort of decorum to a cauldron of infighting, are but two examples of the peek behind the Oval Office curtain. This book is a must-read tat will be referred to for generations.",January-17-2018,5
6222,"Enjoyed Mr. Wolfe's inside view of the first ~9 months of the Trump West Wing. Disturbing because I'm fairly sure that he didn't exaggerate the the chaos, the ineptitude, or the utter insanity of it all.",January-11-2018,5

Maybe a feeble attempt, but will probably yield more than contacting my representatives in Congress who only fire back broad and inane letters about their ""leadership"". Is the content true?

6228,Good read,February-18-2018,5
6229,The book Fire And Fury was a detailed representation of what was advertised. It was a good read and in a format that allowed for specific subject matters to be covered in  certain chapters. Well written material by the writer or writers who had to been in the middle of the situation in order to reveal the innermost contents of which one could never just make up. Overall the book was worth the price and a keepsake for political and history buffs.,February-3-2018,5

6231,"Read it in a couple of days. This reinforces, quite forcefully how cynical, criminal, and malicious the Trump Whitehouse truly is. Also clearly shows how terrified the inner circle is of the Mueller investigation. It's rip roaring comedy/ reality show with the star of the show President Caligula and Sloppy Steve.",January-11-2018,5

6234,"Even buying this book is a POWERFUL statement to those of us that believe in truth and rational stability.  The book sheds light on the most dangerous aspects of this man.  To be sure, it is also a testament to the unity of those of us in the #METOO movement who have survived and are now fighting against sexual assault.

6238,Super interesting insight mainly into the 'palace intrigue' / battling factions from within the White House.,February-18-2018,5
6239,"Interesting story, but you need to take on faith what the book says.  It is hard to tell who was just bragging, who was embellishing, and who was interpreting things in their favor.I would also suggest he uses language that adds to the fog index for no reason.",March-9-2018,3

Took a few tries and refreshes but it was finally able to download.  Looks like hard copy is now 2-4 weeks for delivery.Good reading so far and Iâ€™m only a few chapters in!

6246,"Highly recommend this alarming view of the inner workings of the Trump White House. For those who believe this administration is frighteningly inept and out of control, this book shows it is even worse than you think.

6250,"There werenâ€™t many genuine surprises here but the details were riveting. Itâ€™s a well-written, behind-the-scenes account of the daily White House drama weâ€™ve all been watching from the cheap seats.

The author seemed detached and the material overly subjective. I was determined to finish it and relieved when the task was over.  Yes, it was work!",January-11-2018,2
6262,A beautifully written horrifying account of the first year of the Trump presidency. I recommend reading it at least twice!,January-11-2018,5
6263,good reading,February-18-2018,5
6264,"100% true, probably not. Yet if not, it certainly explains much of the time bomb in the Trump Administration. Well worth the read.",January-17-2018,4
6265,"Hermione Granger taught us in The Order of the Phoenix that the best way to ensure something gets read is to ban it.Trump's lawsuit over this book works the same way.I rarely read nonfiction, but I used an Audible credit on this book this morning. Can't wait to read what the president doesn't want me to know!",January-5-2018,5
6266,When a book brings down a presidency.,January-5-2018,5
6267,"What better way to emulate our President than to buy a book that reads itself to you? Best of all, you only have to listen to it in small spurts because you're already bored with it. Hey! Let's go ride bikes! This book improved my golf game significantly. Which is surprising because I was already the best golfer in the history of the world. I especially appreciated the part of the book where Michael Wolff states that Trump is unequivocally the greatest President in American history - except maybe Ben Franklin, I'm told many people think he might have been a better President... Oh, wait, that part isn't in this book. That's right. This one's the Fake News book. I was thinking about that book ""The Art of the Deal."" Now that's literature.",January-11-2018,5
6268,Very well told study of relationships and Trump's failing mental state. But choppy and disjointed and somewhat repetitive. Need more details on Javanka and clarity on Bannon,January-11-2018,3
6269,"A fascinating read . . . or, in this case, a listen!",January-10-2018,5
6270,interesting book.,February-23-2018,5
6271,"POTUS is a batshit crazy narcissistâ€”this book provides the more or less complete backstory. Frightening, riveting and just plain SAD!",January-11-2018,5
6272,"This account of White House personalities and events appears to parallel TV and other media report.  My suspicions of the ineptitude of the wh leadership is confirmed in this account.  It could not possibly be exaggerated!  I recommend this, even if only just out of curiosity.",January-11-2018,3
6273,"Very well written, very insightful, rings very true to my ears.  Trumpâ€™s hubris is at least backed up by his charisma.  Jared and Ivanka have nothing to justify their arrogance and privileged stupidity .  Of course that fatal flaw goes back to the President, and they will also go down together.",January-11-2018,5
6274,"Even if only 1/2 of what's written here is true, it still paints a frightening picture of our current state - a picture the Trump and company continue to reinforce with their ongoing actions and words. I found it a credible depiction of what happened. I enjoyed most of the author's writing style, but his use of what my dad used to call ""two-dollar"" words seems designed to appeal to his fellow journalists and not so much to the rest of us. He could have made the content more accessible by writing clearly, cleanly, and with words the majority of readers would understand. I've got a pretty good vocab, but had to look up a couple of things - really disrupts the flow. Overall, a good read. It makes me even more concerned about the lack of leadership in DC than I was before I read this.",January-14-2018,5
6275,Would have been better if the author had dinner a better job on sources vs. guesses vs. inuendos. Interesting but not authoritative.,February-17-2018,4
6276,Entertaining read..,January-29-2018,5
6277,"I'm not into political books, but it was worth the $15 to show the President of the United States of America that no one, no matter how powerful, can stop the freedom of the press. The fact that this book is a wild ride and total page turner is icing on the already very delicious cake.",January-5-2018,5
6278,The picture this paints is even worse than I had imagined and i can imagine quite a negative White House culture.,January-11-2018,4
6279,Thanks Michael..We needed your book.,April-23-2018,5
6280,No one tells me what I can and cannot read. And no illegitimate resident in the White House..the People's House...is going to remove a book from circulation because he doesn't like the truth.,January-5-2018,5
6281,"The 5 stars are for the effect it has on Trump and how much it must piss him off. Otherwise, I'd give the book itself maybe 3.75/4 stars. In all honesty, there is not a whole lot in there that was a surprise or that hadn't been hinted at before. Still, an entertaining and quick read. I also wanted to buy it just so I could oppose his censorship.",January-10-2018,5
6282,I honestly haven't gotten around to reading this yet. What I love is that pisses off the manchild and empowers his enemies.,January-24-2018,5
6283,"I enjoyed the book.  It is an easy read.  Whether everything is accurate or not was not important to me.  This book did give a better understanding of who many of the people that we see mentioned in the news and associated with Donald Trump; details that many may know but I didn't.  Many are named as to who supported who, names of various individuals of where they had worked how they acquired their wealth and other interesting details.  There was very little mentioned in the book regarding details of Trump and his family that had not already been in the news.  This is not a book for anyone that is a blind follower of the current administration.  I would recommend  the book.",January-17-2018,5
6284,"I was pretty disappointed in the book, to be honest. There is SO MUCH conjecturing. How could Wolff know what people were doing and thinking behind closed doors? There are few reliable quotes. I saw Wolff on ""The View"" and he just did not seem to be a very honest person. The book DOES set down the facts of who was in the White House and when. If that interests you, go ahead and get this book.  I will not recommend this book to my friends as the juiciest parts of the book were already discussed on the major news outlets.  They have already moved on to the sh*thole comment. (Which was predictably denied)",January-14-2018,2
6285,"Not much that we didn't already know, but a bit of an eye opener in terms of the behind the scenes in fighting and organizational chaos.",January-11-2018,3
6286,Mostly a rehash of what I already knew watching CNN when it happened.  The author could not have first hand knowledge.  And I do not care for Trump.  In fact think he is a vile and ignorant man.,March-7-2018,1
6287,Outstanding book read it cover to cover in less than a day! Hope you get taken on for the sequel or write Omarosa's book !,January-11-2018,5
6288,Didn't shock me at all as anyone paying attention knows this administration is a disaster.,January-11-2018,5
6289,"Bringing together the entire Trump campaign and then the first ten months of the disastrous Trump presidency, Wolff carefully explains and documents how it all happened! Truly a masterpiece!",January-11-2018,5
6290,"As an MSNBC junkie, I thought I'd already heard all the Hugh points of the book discussed on tv. Nope. Reading the book itself just presented more info to back.up the original claims. Michael Wolff is a patriot for making this info available to the public. Trump supporters should read this with an open mind and rethink their support for such a dishonest and sick leader. Hello Pulitzer prize (and impeachment)''",January-11-2018,5
6291,Book is interesting - so many typos in the Kindle edition.,January-20-2018,3

6293,Hard to believe everything but enough is provably true to be a potentially explosively diuretic coda to the Trump white house.,January-11-2018,3
6294,"I just bought Fire and Fury as much to make a statement as to find out what Wolfe found out as he interviewed Trumpâ€™s minions. The statement Iâ€™m making is showing Trump that he might have many powers as the candidate elected by the Electoral College, but he canâ€™t sign a presidential proclamation denying an author the right to write and publish a book critical of him. And someone in the White House might want to inform him of the 1964 landmark Supreme Court case New York Times v. Sullivan before he runs out and makes statements about his intent to sue Wolfe for libel.",January-5-2018,5
6295,"Informative, thought provoking and insightful. The real truth behind the tweeting, alt-right and Charlottesville rationalizations. I wait on every word and every chapter. This is HUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGEEEEEE!",January-10-2018,5
6296,what do you expect from an overgrown child actuallt i think a child could do better... and not talking about mr. wolff,February-18-2018,3
6297,"Before trashing this book as ""chum for liberal"" and expertly commenting on it - you should read it. It is not a trash Trump book - it describes behind the scenes wrangling, power plays on his staff. It's a very interesting narrative and portrays Trump often in a very sympathetic way. That he just wants to be liked. Bannon is the most sinister character and portrayed the most negatively. A compelling read.",January-11-2018,5
6298,"When unbalanced Trump decided to block the publication of this book I new I had to buy it. Excellent read, very amusing and entertaining. All you actually new about the Moron and much much more. Needs to be impeached as soon as possible.",January-7-2018,5
6299,INTERESTING BOOK,January-24-2018,5
6300,"Mostly just adds detail to what has already been leaked and reported. Still worth it. Worth it just to read Trump stunned people would care about the Russia myth in Trump Tower because Don Jr ""is a good boy."" And all this SVUs about NYC socialite kids raping and the parents defending them all make sense.",January-24-2018,4

6303,"If you want to know what really happened, simply read this book.  More information than you can possibly imagine!!!",March-9-2018,5
6304,I'd like to believe everything I read in this book because I'm no fan of the Trump administration however I am aware that I have to take what Wolf writes on faith. For the most part the book is merely gossip.,March-18-2018,4
6305,A fun listen in the car. The voice actor is very expressive and does a great job. A story of ignorance and privilege.,January-10-2018,4
6306,Entertaining read and a great compliment to the President's twitter feed.  A well written; riveting story telling how it really is in the WH.,January-6-2018,5
6307,Awesome!,January-14-2018,5
6308,A canâ€™t put it down Machiavellian tale of the tRump White House. Clearly shows how out of his depth the president really is. I fear the Republic will never recover. Bannon should be held accountable for treason.,January-11-2018,5
6309,"Yesterday, the president referred to himself as a ""stable genius."" The president in this book is more moron than Mensa.  There are some proofreading problems here and there, but damn, this is a heck of a read, sort of a ""Not the Best or the Brightest"" (sic) with my apologies to David Halberstam.  Forget the nitpicking pundits on television, this a juicy rhetorical ribeye, loaded with lots of red meat for the reader.  Entertaining and with the proverbial ring of truth.",January-7-2018,5
6310,"Trump is angry for this book being published. I hope its a best seller by next week for no other reason than I am sick and tired of this president ""demanding"" anything from anyone. He is about as important as a drop of water in a full bucket.",January-5-2018,5
6311,"Could not buy in book form - all sold out - so read it on my Kindle.  Quite a fun read.  The only drawback is reliving the nightmare of the past year in 328 pages!!  I, however, believe the book is true because to quote Spicer, ""You can't make this stuff up!""  (Or to quote G. W. Bush, ""That is some crazy shit!"")  So not just democrats are amazed!  I will be buying a hard copy just to put on my shelf.",January-11-2018,5
6312,"This was probably the worst book I have ever read. It read like it was thrown together quickly with no organization and no clear purpose. The sad revelation is that this entire administration, from the president to the lowest clerk, was described as incompetent and only concerned with the in fighting in Washington and destroying each other for one's own gain. The entire book was spent describing the cabinet positions, who was to fill them, when they would be fired or resign, and who was the cause of that action.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.",March-29-2018,1
6313,"Entertaining to read, but ridiculous to believe. Author states something as fact in one chapter and then contradicts himself in another.",February-5-2018,3
6314,"Love the book! Highly recommend it!""Fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.â€ù lol This book would be a great ready-to-use script for a documentary on Trump's presidency, hopefully soon.",January-10-2018,5
6315,A lot to think about after reading this.  Very interesting.  Scary too when you think about all that took place.,January-11-2018,5
6316,"Itâ€™s a provocative listen. Even if there is a lot of misreporting, you get an idea of the circus happening in this administration. Itâ€™s simply entertaining!!",January-10-2018,4
6317,I for one did not vote for this man. But I am certain he will claim that I did.,January-5-2018,5

6320,I am convienced the president is the wrong man,February-9-2018,5
6321,"It wasn't a ""bad"" book, but if you've been watching the news and/or following the various catastrophes surrounding Trump you'll already know the vast majority of the information in here. For someone not aware of anything that's transpired, it would probably be a 4 star book, for me I'll stick with 3. I got through it, but didn't learn much along the way.",January-27-2018,3
6322,"Much of the information presented in this book was known, or at the very least suspected. Still, it is a fascinating look at the absolute chaos of Trump and his band of incompetents. Everyone thinks they can control the fool, but they underestimate their own stupidity. We live in scary times.",January-7-2018,5

6325,"Wanted to see what the people really thought  about Donald Trump.Could  not put  this book down.Reading about the inside workings of the White House, the intrigue, the drama, and the sad fact that this is American history,  was worth every penny spent on this book. I just started my 2nd read, it's  that interesting. Every American citizen needs to read this  book. Truth or Fiction it's  worth it.",January-11-2018,4
6326,Slow reading and disregard the editing flaws. They add to the flawed pattern of speech of the #45. What a coincidence!,February-18-2018,3
6327,"The story in this book is a scary one.  At the same time, it is maddening and frustrating.  You will find yourself shaking your head throughout the book.  The book confirms your worst fears about the state of our country, we are living through a nightmare.  It's a must read for all patriots.",January-11-2018,5
6328,Interesting read. I do have a problem when the author tells what a person is thinking or quotes dialogue. I cannot see where any of these people would tell a reporter their innermost thoughts or leak that particular conversation.,January-14-2018,3
6329,I got the audio version for a free trial and Blood Meridian to boot. Interesting insight at the very least.,January-5-2018,5
6330,"Brave and well documented. A truly patriotic  work. Buy it now, especially if you voted for Trump. It will  change your mind.",January-11-2018,5
6331,"Not much of this book is actually new. Except for the explosive excerpts leaked already, everything else you thought you knew is accurate about Trump. Itâ€™s truly a shame. Also, clearly the author spent an enormous amount of time with Bannon and most of this book is his interpretation of events. Everything in here has already been reported just with anonymous sources. You already know 90% of whatâ€™s in here.",January-7-2018,4
6332,This book would have been more enjoyable had the author not felt the need to use obscure words that a normal person would never use.,January-24-2018,4
6333,"I liked all of it, because all of it is true !!!!!!!",February-13-2018,2
6334,"Mr. Wolff gives us a account of just how dysfunctional everything about the White House and the Trumps actually is.  He presents facts and small scenes to support his positions.  I think it an important book but just like everything else, the Trumps will trash it.  In the Trump world there is no good there.  I hope the book hastens his impeachment.",January-10-2018,5
6335,Required reading for all Americans. If half of this is true we are in serious trouble.,January-11-2018,5
6336,"Well written, hard to put down.",January-17-2018,5
6337,"Even though youâ€™ve already heard the juiciest tidbits from this book, itâ€™s still a fascinating read.",January-10-2018,5
6338,"I only bought this book after Trump's lawyers tried to block it, otherwise I just would have read the highlights from the fake media.So far, everything in here is mostly what has already been reported by the fake media and nothing is really surprising. I expect the rest of the book to be more of the same. Nobody in his camp expected to win, they were just doing it for visibility. Trump is full of himself, nobody on staff knows what they are doing, he doesn't know who he is talking to most of the time, he repeats himself, doesn't understand the most basic functions of government, and in general is terribly unfit to be president.If Trump upsets you, this book will re-affirm your issues and probably upset you more. If you are one of those people that voted for Trump because he has the backs of the little guys and is going to drain the swamp and ""those e-mails though!"", this certainly won't change your mind because this book is obviously left propaganda paid for by Hillary and is fake news.",January-9-2018,4

6341,The book confirmed everything thatâ€™s been in the MSM over the past year...and itâ€™s not fake news,January-17-2018,5
6342,Good book. A lot of the sensational moments have already been picked up by the media. Thus is all about Bannon vs the Jarvanka wing. Now that Bannon is out it does not appear that the presidency is heading further more moderate Jarvanka wing which makes you question their influence,January-29-2018,3
6343,A fairly easy read and enticing.  I am hopeful that it will be turned into a tv event so the audience is larger.  Can see where a few facts could be overlooked but overall it lays out just like the first 9 months have...,January-20-2018,5
6344,"It was a good read, I don't know how accurate. I heard a lot of this stuff in from elsewhere.",January-28-2018,4
6345,"This provides keen insight into the current administration.  It's not perfect, but it's very good.",January-5-2018,5
6346,This book exposes my biggest fears. We have a crazy person in the White House!  I hope he is removed soon and that moving forward we must conduct psychological evaluations  for anyone running for President.  Hopefully this will be a lesson we learn without people losing their lives. So horrified that our Nation must suffer due to this one man we call trump.,January-10-2018,5
6347,"I know a lot of ""conservatives"" hate this book; well, I consider myself a liberal Democrat and I didn't like it either.  The pretext that Wolff used for gaining the entry to the White House was despicable imho.  In addition, Wolff like too many authors ""dumbs down"" the readers using obscure and confusing wording.  I am well read but not a professor of the English language but had a dictionary on my smart phone to look up the meaning of a lot of the text.In addition, I think the fact that our beloved president cats around and how many former Presidents share that distinction?  The attack on a member of the Trump administration toward the end of the book was unprofessional and bordered on libel imho.  I have no problem with some of the book, but one could argue that if you watched CNN 24/7 you would have the  same information.  I do not like President Trump but I like Mr. Wolff even  less. Wait a few more weeks and buy one used with the money saved you can buy a dictionary to figure this slime ball's diction.",March-10-2018,2
6348,"You're pulled in at the prologue.  Not impeccably written,  FULL of typos and misspellings probably the worst editing I've ever seen,  you get past it as you're sucked into the chaos that is the Trump White House.

6353,I only bought this book because Donnie tried to stop it.,April-18-2018,5
6354,"I am on page 60 and this is one boring book. While I know the author is an educated man but his writing style does not do it for me at all. He rambles and uses the biggest words he can find in ""search for words to use to make people think you are smart.""  His writing style is very difficult to keep track of what he is saying.  I'm not impressed but I will attempt to read for at least 150 pages and see if there is anything worth my time.The first part of this review was written after 60 pages.  I plowed through to the end. So many times I had to read a paragraph over several times to wade through what the author was saying.  Shortly after the 60 pages there were more ""details"".  It was really a ""Bannon"" book. It is interesting nothing much said at all about Sarah Huckabee-Sanders and her monotone reporting.  She talks down to the press and is insulting and sounds like she is spinning most everything. I'm surprised she isn't mentioned in depth.",January-28-2018,2
6355,"I was looking forward to reading candid recounts from inside the dysfunctional administration, but the writing in this book - being some of the more painful text I've suffered through - made it impossible.

6376,"I neither like nor respect Trump. (I won't even dignify him by using his courtesy title.) That stated, I can't recommend this screed for a number of reasons.Although this is not my main criticism, the sheer number of editing errors (such as ""was was"") speak to how hastily this book was released, and as such, the book reads less like a compilation of issues and observations that lead to conclusions than a completely malicious list of grievances against Trump that the author already harbored and for which he was looking for justification(s).The author clearly relies heavily on discussions with/observations of Steve Bannon, probably the most loathsome player in the Trump drama, and portrays Bannon as the fulcrum behind a significant number of Trump's actions. And while I am not suggesting that the author depict Bannon as being a blameless, charming, nice and/or truthful human being if he isn't, (again, according to the author's subjective view,) the author disparages Bannon in such a way as to undermine whatever credibility Bannon might have within the book. And since Bannon is so central to the story, if he's undermined, so is the story Wolff tells.This book reads less like a contribution to the developing Trump presidency canon than a salacious, mean-spirited and pointless jeremiad meant to cash in on Trump's ever-dwindling popularity and the ever-mounting questions concerning Trump's sanity, thanks, in part, to this book. This is a nasty book in the style of Rona Barrett, without Wolff having Barrett's grace to admit that he's just a gossip monger and, in his case, one with dubious sources, a taste for invective, and a ""literary"" track record that I should have considered at greater length and more seriously before wasting money on this piece of trash.There are other, far better books that have been written about Trump. They are far more cohesive and foretold what is now happening with Trump. Likewise, 'How Democracies Die' portends to be more helpful in explaining what is happening in an administration that may well represent a significant decline in the ability of this democracy to survive.This book made me want to take a good, scalding shower after reading it - exactly the same way I'd feel if I ever got to shake Trump's hand, which I would decline to do.",January-11-2018,2
6377,Read the title it says it all - very scary  .......  this administration desperately needs to find its way befor,January-16-2018,3
6378,"Very interesting. Itâ€™s basically everything weâ€™ve already heard, just in better detail.",January-10-2018,5
6379,"If you follow political news, there is not much new information that is revealed in this book. I honestly donâ€™t understand the hype around this book.",January-15-2018,3
6380,Itâ€™s tax time people!  Why check that little box for the Presidential Election Fund when your money can be better served buying this book! Probably wouldnâ€™t have without the recommendation of 45. A bigly thank you to you sir!,January-6-2018,5
6381,This is a well-written book- my lackluster review is more a reflection of how upsetting the subject matter is than the book itself. Itâ€™s terrifying. Just... yikes.,January-11-2018,3
6382,"The author leaves little out, and leaves it up to the reader to make decisions - well done!",January-10-2018,5
6383,"It shows the terrible dysfunction of the Trump White House.  While many of these stories have already been reported, this compiles them and adds to them to create a nauseating picture of a true train wreck.",January-11-2018,5
6384,"Had no intention of buying this book, however, after all the fuss about it, I just had to read it. Oh what tangled webs we weave ...",January-11-2018,5
6385,A fascinating insight into an administration that never should've come to power. Wolff provides a compelling look into the Trump White House that feels harrowing to read and yet impossible to put down. This is the type of book that should be taught in schools to illustrate how no one is above the law. It's the best book I've read on the Trump administration by far.,January-5-2018,5
6386,"Just bought it on my kindle.  I'm about to head into a 24 hour stretch of work.  Read the Wolff article in New York Magazine which was enough for me.  But when Trump tried to halt publication, I immediately bought it.  Partly for what I assume will be fun reading (about which much is already known) but more importantly to protest the attempt to ban the publishing of the book.",January-5-2018,5
6387,Penetrating look that rings more true day by day.,January-25-2018,5
6388,"An okay read, ignore the gossip about Trump's habits and read for the emphasis on power dynamics in the administration.",January-19-2018,3
6389,Don't know what to believe about this book. The author is a good writer. This is interesting to say the least.  I am glad I read it,January-20-2018,4
6390,Not really any substantiated information that is new to those who follow the news. Just a lot of hearsay about the incompetence of the Trump administration.,January-29-2018,3
6391,Got it in time!  Thank you so much.,January-11-2018,5
6392,Dull as a doll house.,March-7-2018,1
6393,"The information in the book fits perfectly with the behavior we have seen since Trump became president.  It's an absolutely chilling expose of what is going on inside the administration, and should give anyone who cares about this country and this democracy reason to be concerned about America's future.",January-10-2018,5
6394,"Very easy read, most of my work colleagues are lining up to read it.",February-15-2018,5
6395,Not impressd. This book just reiterates all the things from in the news.,February-12-2018,3
6396,The author comes across as honest. The description of events sadly and scary resonates with me. The horror show that is the US right now,January-5-2018,5
6397,It was very interesting to see what goes on in the White House  .I could not put it down.,February-3-2018,5
6398,How could the Democrats let such a horrible person be elected?  I suspected all of this now it is confirmed. A great book,January-22-2018,5
6399,"It puts names with stories we have heard and confirms suspicions of what we have seen in trump character for over 45 years.When someone shows you who they are, believe them.",January-11-2018,5
6400,Michael Wolf was able to put together everything we already knew. Interesting book.,January-10-2018,4
6401,Just to piss of Trumptards- will be buying 20 copies for my friends and family.,January-5-2018,5
6402,Received the boook when promised. New condition. Cant wait to read it.,February-15-2018,4
6403,Poorly written,March-9-2018,1
6404,A fancinating and scary look into the Trump Whitehouse.,January-10-2018,5
6405,"I have likely already heard most of the crazy stuff in this book via the massive media coverage.  I will still read the entire thing, if for no other reason than that this is America and I am disgusted that Donald Trump thinks he can ban a book because he doesnt like the contents.  I dont know if it is all true (although frankly it seems to only confirm tons of reporting to the fact) but no one tells me what I can or cant read.",January-5-2018,5
6406,"A lot to think about in this book. Mr. Wolff gives many facts that I'd forgotten about, making it hard to believe that Trump is still our president after all he's done to show his stupidity!",January-11-2018,5
6407,A good read. Not as shocking or salacious as all the press and Mr Trumpâ€™s tweets would have you believe. If Trump got a cut I would think he is self promoting it.,January-11-2018,5
6408,Nothing but hearsay and fantasy. Waste of money.,March-28-2018,1
6409,Audible was a good venue for this book. The reader was an asset to the text.,January-10-2018,4
6410,A must read,January-10-2018,5
6411,Not as exciting or full of revelation as I thought it might be.,January-27-2018,3
6412,This book is horrible. There are no footnotes. He makes all these claims without naming the source. It is clearly written with definite biase.  Donâ€™t buy it. It is a waste of time and money.,March-13-2018,1
6413,Because . . .1ST AMENDMENT,January-6-2018,5
6414,"What makes Fire and Fury a must read isn't in the writing, it's the fact that it captures the a moment in our history. It doesn't matter what is true and what is exaggerated. What matters is that the office of the President continues to capture our attention at unprecedented levels. This book doesn't do anything particularly well or break any ground but it is thoroughly entertaining because it paints a picture of the inner workings of American politics that we rarely see. It's so rare to have an administration that functions this way and this book is both a description and a reflection of that (dys)function. Truthfully, it is a pretty run of the mill political book. Readers will have to determine the credibility of the author and your own political views, as per usual in America, will determine whether or not you enjoy reading things you may or may not want to believe. If you're a Trump supporter, this book probably won't change your opinion. If you dislike the direction America has taken under Trump, you will likely revel in this depiction of our Commander in Chief as a complete and utter man-baby. The bottom line is that everybody is talking about this book. If that's not a good reason to read a book, then don't bother. In a month, nobody will care. There aren't any revelations in this book you won't see on the cable news shows discussing the book. Still, it's an incredibly fun read if you're into current events and politics.",January-6-2018,4
6415,"This would be a hilarious depiction of the Trump White House if it weren't so scary and sad. But okay, I did laugh a lot. If you have been following the chaos of Trump, Bannon & Co., there's nothing new here, but the book does go deeper on all the nutty stories and outbursts of the last two years. I found the insights worth reading as they gave me a better understanding of what's happening in the West Wing. The buffoonery somehow made me feel a little easier - as in our country is more being taken apart by incompetence than pure evil, though certainly there's some of that. This is a good page-turner, but man there are a lot of typos and errors in it. They should have spent the weekend proofreading the thing instead of releasing it early.",January-17-2018,3
6416,I have been listening to the book on Audible and it is captivating.  Narrator is great with good voice inflection.There is a great deal more in the book than what has been covered in the media.  It is also beneficial to hear the excerpts that were already covered heard again in the proper sequence of the book.  The book presents events in a timeline that is well explained and easy to follow.I still wake up some mornings and feel I am in the Twilight Zone and this really can't be our reality.  I plan on listening to the book twice.  I really want this to sink in.  I don't want our kids  looking back and wonder how we could let all of  this happen.,January-5-2018,5
6417,The narrator was a pleasure to listen to. Pleasant timbre.,January-10-2018,5
6418,"I am barely 45 minutes in and say if I could give this book a million stars it still is not enough stars. So far, I have enjoyed every word spoken. I got the book to find out what all the hubbub was all about and was it was worth it. I am going to get a hard copy from the bookstore too.",January-10-2018,5
6419,"The book has been released earlier today January 5, 2018 Friday at 9 am EST due to overwhelming public demand and is now rank #1 on Amazon bestseller list as of this writing. It was rank 48,000 one day before Trumpâ€™s attempt to censor this book. I guess the author has to thank Trump for the unintended publicity. I must say this book has been extremely entertaining especially if you have been following politics and the Trump administration for the past year or so and I canâ€™t stop laughing or giggling on every page. Well worth the $15 I paid for the Kindle version.",January-5-2018,5
6420,Interesting read....,January-11-2018,5
6421,A must read by everyone of voting age.,January-10-2018,5
6422,Purchased mostly due to the tweeter-in-chief's furious desire to stop the book from being published. So far the content seems well written and about what I expected.,January-5-2018,5
6423,"4.75 stars..(proofing errors mostly) As many have said,this book is compellingly readable. I lived through Watergate and other traumatic political times without as much news coverage. I am very interested to see that much if not all of the events in the book have already transpired or are happening right now.Time of course will tell which things hold up in the courts but into the courts they are going. What do we have to go on with a non-transparent White House except journalism? First Amendment is everything for now.",February-1-2018,5
6424,Hilarious and frightening insider account of the chaos that is the Trump White House.,February-3-2018,4

6426,"Half truth, half fiction, all very badly written, and of no redeeming value. this book is total  a disgrace to journalism.",February-1-2018,3
6427,"Started reading, got bored less than halfway in. Nobodyâ€™s fault, just my opinion. Iâ€™ll pass it on or put it in the box for thrift store.",February-27-2018,3
6428,"Provide a great level of insight into the different factions in the White House, and of a person who is over his orange head",January-11-2018,5
6429,"Very quick, addictive read.  Gives new insight on the nightmare that is Jarvanka.  When Bannon is the most level headed guy in your White House, youâ€™ve got problems.",January-11-2018,5
6430,It is what it is. Poorly edited ok writing.,January-18-2018,3
6431,"Just bought it so can not address the book itself.  However, if Trump wanted this book suppressed then it is my patriotic duty to support the first amendment and by this book. So my message is this, just get it.",January-5-2018,5
6432,Anything Trump hates you will love!  Believe me bigly!,February-18-2018,5

6435,I don't know if I'm more angry or sad after reading this book. Kudos to Wolff for getting all this out there.,January-11-2018,5
6436,"I reiterate what others have already stated: I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever read this book - I donâ€™t think I need reminding that our country is in the tiny hands of an orange gnome. However, I loathe censorship and will do my part in ensuring this book soars to the top of the bestseller list.",January-5-2018,5
6437,"Whether 50%, 80%, or 100% true, the insight into the double-crossing, backbiting, and palace intrigue of what has been the Trump Whitehouse is a piece of drama and history of the ages. Better than any Roman or Byzantine contest for power. Raw and personal with the tornado of The Don in the middle. A great read!",January-11-2018,5
6438,I'm no Trump supporter but I think this work is poorly written and the facts are at best suspect. I gave up about half way through...,March-7-2018,1

6443,"No one, not even a president, should have the right to ban a book. I bought this because I support freedom of the press and freedom of speech, but I read it because I wanted to know more than I did. I do now. This book will terrify you because you know it is all true.",January-5-2018,5
6444,Can't stop listening it. Best book I've got in many years!,January-5-2018,5
6445,The book contained some current information.  Too gossipy.  Details need to be fact checked - as if that is always possible.,March-25-2018,1
6446,"Interesting book and proves what I had always thought about the mess going on in the White House. How anything at all gets done is a miracle, please get this buffoon (Trump) out of office stat,",January-7-2018,4
6447,"Definitely worth reading. It's intriguing being able to see the President in all his immature, unqualified, incompetent glory from someone who had inside access. Very interesting and enlightening.",January-6-2018,5
6448,"The book has some minor errors in it, but overall it is a pretty gripping book to read. Believe me, (Trump pun intended) it is not boring in the least bit. I have read a lot of political books and this has got to be by far the best and most entertaining of all the political books that I have read. I bought a Kindle version and I also bought a hard copy for a family member.  If anything I want to show my support to the author and the publishers. Trump is trying so desperately to stop the publication of this book and I think censorship is very Un-American.  In buying this book I show my support for American values one of which is a not censoring journalists or books just because we don't like them.",January-5-2018,5
6449,Just got this!  Rolling up my sleeves to read this one.Thank you Amazon!* Will write another review when I have finished reading.,January-12-2018,5

6456,Media has covered a lot of the book but it is fun to hear the background.,January-10-2018,5
6457,"An incredibly important and well written book detailing the dark catastrophe of the Trump presidency.  I'm certain in the centuries to come (yes, centuries) this will be a text turned to again and again to try to understand what happened.",January-5-2018,5
6458,"Pre-Armageddon primary reading. A fun read for the grandkids on those cold nuclear winter nights! Don't know if it's all ""fake news"", but it seems spot-on if you put it side by side with daily reports of white house dysfunctional shenanigans. Goes great with cheeseburgers and early bedtimes!!",January-10-2018,5
6459,"Wow. The book describes an administration where almost everybody is on their own self-serving ego trip, sabotaging one another for the good favour of the man at the top. This book would be completely unbelievable if it didn't explain the chaos observed from the outside of this White House so well.",January-7-2018,5

6464,have not read yet but looking forward to it,January-30-2018,5
6465,Worth the money just as a way to piss off Trump. Plus the book is pretty entertaining,January-14-2018,5
6466,We watched this book unfold in real time on tv and twitter. The attempts to discredit are pathetic. Watch and read trumps interviews...he validates the book.,January-11-2018,5

6468,"I liked the details, but feel the book was too wordy",February-16-2018,5
6469,It is an entertaining read.  But do not take it as a factual depiction of events.  It is more about descriptions of the personalities...,January-11-2018,3
6470,"I thought I'd be satisfied with the excerpts that are being floated around, but each one intrigued me more, and finally I had to have the whole sordid tale.  The book is excellent, and if you can't tell that it rings true you haven't been paying attention. Also, I have the added bonus joy of enraging the orange baby - cease and desist THIS now that it's sold hundreds of thousands of copies. The longer it's number one, the more frantic he will be - fun to watch.Sadly, while this horror show is going on, there are all sorts of nefarious actors hiding behind the chaos, doing real harm to our ideals and institutions.  This book shines a little light on some of them, another important benefit.",January-5-2018,5
6471,One of the weakest book on the subject.,April-27-2018,3
6472,"I am not sure if this is all true as the author is vague with his sources. I am questioning how he was able to be so present at the White House.However, most of it is interesting and supports my view of President Trump. Other parts are boring and repetitive.",January-23-2018,3
6473,Item received timely and as advertised,April-2-2018,4
6474,"This is written as though it is fiction, and I think it should be treated with the same amount of skepticism normally accorded something that claims to be based on reality (or at least, do not suspend disbelief per usual). Wolff said he was interested in the characters, and that's what's here: a politically themed, reality-tv-show-style soap opera in narrative form. Don't expect a detailed breakdown of the intricacies of political negotiations or analysis of how these peculiar personalities might impact that process. Do expect a lot of repetition and misspellings, as I'm pretty sure this was rushed to print before an editor saw it. Heck, even before a second draft. And expect, too, what might be gossip? Depending on if the narrator is reliable? The truth is... somewhere out there.",January-18-2018,3

6489,Interesting insight into the disturbing and dark world of Trumpâ€™s White House. It could have used some more corroboration on certain accusations.The writing is captivating and makes this a page turner.

6525,"Stop Calling Them ""Immigrants"": They are PHIs (Persons Here Illegally) - The Solution Begins with Using the Right TermI hesitate to give reviews of fewer than three stars but I will ""grade on a curve"" when it comes to bestsellers. People have a right to know what they're getting.If we filter out all the ""1-star""  and ""5-star"" ratings, by Trump supporters and bashers, respectively, let's get down to what this book really is: a squandered opportunity by a person lucky enough to have been blessed with virtually unlimited White House access. Michael Wolff had a golden opportunity to write the first important historical account of the Trump presidency, and he threw it all away for the cheap thrills of empty gossip and innuendo.""It might be true"" is not good enough.Worse yet, Wolff's perspective is that of one of the countless people who have no clue why Trump won.  (Hint: if you read my book, Stop Calling Them Immigrants [see link above], you find out why in the Conclusion: IMMIGRATION is the reason.)Wolff jumps of the theme of chaos and runs with it throughout the book. Not that anyone would argue with straight face that the Trump White House is eminently smooth and harmonious, but there are so many more powerful themes that epitomize this presidency - not least of which a national assailing of the major party establishmentarian duopoly - that ""chaos"" barely cracks the top 10.So if this book was so bad in my view, why not give it just one star? Because it is well written. Wolff is a talented wordsmith. Too bad he didn't put that talent to the more noble pursuit of presidential history. Thucydides he ain't....",March-11-2018,2

I don't think it is as much a put down as Fox News made it out to be, nor is it as true as CNN would want you to believe.  President Trump is getting the job done, and like the book shows, we knew he wouldn't be ""political""; he's a business man.

6561,"Let's not beat around the bush: Not everything in this book is accurate. Some of the grammar and typos are unreal for an editor not to catch (e.g. ""the presidential primary was still competitive in the winter of 2016"" or ""they had another think coming""). Some of the facts are just wrong.And yet this is exactly the kind of post-truth coverage that is deserving of this post-truth administration. Had a reputable journalist published this work with facts triple-checked and quotes reproduced verbatim, Trump would have attacked the media, called it fake news, and moved on. But Wolff's gripping pages, not letting mere objective truth stand in the way, truly get to the heart of the disaster that is this terrible man and the disease he has brought to this country. That is why this tale cannot be dismissed. Trump has scored his victories against facts. But when it comes to tests of character, he has always failed.",January-7-2018,4

6563,"Readers who follow politics and/or its increasingly symbiotic relationship to the media won't find much new information about President Trump in ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House."" This lack is more than compensated by Wolff's detailed portraits of not only the power players comprising Trump's inner circle but also those who want in, and those who prefer to run their own little fiefdoms that circumvent the president. The handful of Cabinet members, high level staff and advisors Wolff depicts as qualified for their roles are routinely stymied or ignored. Another handful are very shady, a few even criminal.  Most staffers are depicted as decent people increasingly occupied with preventing or calming Trump's explosive tirades and trying to mitigate damage from the many (most already well-publicized) episodes Wolff presents. He must, of course, mention the episodes in order to make his real contribution--showing the collateral damage to staff at all levels, a more important story than reports of a Department Secretary or similarly high-placed official insulting Trump sotto voce. The surprise is that so few insults have been leaked; the White House is a sieve according to Wolff. I expected to be disturbed by the details this book adds to my picture of our government deeply imperiled, and I am. What I didn't see coming was Wolff's characterization of the press in general as self-loathing. Self-loathing in general?",January-14-2018,3

6604,"I bought both this Kindle version and the Audible.com version. Both were set to publish on January 9th, but the furor over its release forced the publisher to release both versions early. So early, in fact, that some 150 people were able to post reviews before I even could listen to the audio or read the Kindle.Indeed, as a speed reader myself, I am amazed that so many folks could read it so quickly.Here is my take, only about half way through:BUY THIS BOOK TODAY IN KINDLE AND AUDIBLE FORMAT. WHY? It is probably the most honest, real depiction, recorded as it actually is happening. Readers of my reviews will know that i am no Trump fan, but books reporting favorably on him have received impartial treatment by me. Same can be said of reviews I posted regarding HRC - when the book was bad, or dull, I reported such observations. When it came across as heartfelt and authentic, I praised it.BLUSH FACTOR Bearing in mind that this is a book reflecting the language spoken by people whom most of us know are familiar with so-called locker room language (I abhor such terms but i am trying to consolidate here), use your own judgment as to reading this to your youngster or to your elderly grandmother. Myself, i probably would read most of it aloud, but i would leave out the f-words, in a show of respect to my elders and as a matter of leadership to the youth.Fire and Fury is such an interesting, insightful book not laced with prejudicial statements by the author either in favor the Trump or to deride the man whom I believe to be the greatest barker of my generation.A book that seems to actually support much of the worth of this book is ""Let Trump be Trump"" by Corey R. Lewandowski and David N. Bossie (which is, arguably, the most prejudicial publication ever produced in favor of Trump) . Especially telling was their discussion of the man most responsible for Lewandowski becoming Trump's campaign manager - Roger Stone [refer to page 49 of Let Trump Be Trump].Let this excerpt from 4% into the book whet your appetite:â€œWhereâ€™s Donald on this?â€ù asked Ailes, now with the clear implication that Bannon was far out ahead of his benefactor.â€œHeâ€™s totally on board.â€ùâ€œFocused?â€ùâ€œHe buys it.â€ùâ€œI wouldnâ€™t give Donald too much to think about,â€ù said an amused Ailes.Bannon snorted. â€œToo much, too littleâ€”doesnâ€™t necessarily change things.â€ùâ€œWhat has he gotten himself into with the Russians?â€ù pressed Ailes.â€œMostly,â€ù said Bannon, â€œhe went to Russia and he thought he was going to meet Putin. But Putin couldnâ€™t give a sxxt about him. So heâ€™s kept trying.â€ùâ€œHeâ€™s Donald,â€ù said Ailes.â€œItâ€™s a magnificent thing,â€ù said Bannon, who had taken to regarding Trump as something like a natural wonder, beyond explanation.Again, as though setting the issue of Trump asideâ€”merely a large and peculiar presence to both be thankful for and to have to abideâ€”Bannon, in the role he had conceived for himself, the auteur of the Trump presidency, charged forward:â€œChinaâ€™s everything. Nothing else matters. We donâ€™t get China right, we donâ€™t get anything right. This whole thing is very simple. China is where Nazi Germany was in 1929 to 1930. The Chinese, like the Germans, are the most rational people in the world, until theyâ€™re not. And theyâ€™re gonna flip like Germany in the thirties. Youâ€™re going to have a hypernationalist state, and once that happens you canâ€™t put the genie back in the bottle.â€ùâ€œDonald might not be Nixon in China,â€ù said Ailes, deadpan, suggesting that for Trump to seize the mantle of global transformation might strain credulity.Bannon smiled. â€œBannon in China,â€ù he said, with both remarkable grandiosity and wry self-deprecation.â€œHowâ€™s the kid?â€ù asked Ailes, referring to Trumpâ€™s son-in-law and paramount political adviser, thirty-six-year-old Jared Kushner.â€œHeâ€™s my partner,â€ù said Bannon, his tone suggesting that if he felt otherwise, he was nevertheless determined to stay on message.â€œReally?â€ù said a dubious Ailes.â€œHeâ€™s on the team.â€ùâ€œHeâ€™s had lot of lunches with Rupert.â€ùâ€œIn fact,â€ù said Bannon, â€œI could use your help here.â€ù Bannon then spent several minutes trying to recruit Ailes to help kneecap Murdoch. Ailes, since his ouster from Fox, had become only more bitter towards Murdoch. Now Murdoch was frequently jawboning the president-elect and encouraging him toward establishment moderationâ€”all a strange inversion in the ever-stranger currents of American conservatism. Bannon wanted Ailes to suggest to Trump, a man whose many neuroses included a horror of forgetfulness or senility, that Murdoch might be losing it.â€œIâ€™ll call him,â€ù said Ailes. â€œBut Trump would jump through hoops for Rupert.Rupert. Like for Putin. Sucks up and sxxxs down. I just worry about whoâ€™s jerking whose chain.â€ùThe older right-wing media wizard and the younger (though not by all that much) continued on to the other guestsâ€™ satisfaction until twelve-thirty, the older trying to see through to the new national enigma that was Trumpâ€”although Ailes would say that in fact Trumpâ€™s behavior was ever predictableâ€”and the younger seemingly determined not to spoil his own moment of destiny.â€œDonald Trump has got it. Heâ€™s Trump, but heâ€™s got it. Trump is Trump,â€ù affirmed Bannon. â€œYeah, heâ€™s Trump,â€ù said Ailes, with something like incredulity.Wolff, Michael.

6615,"In all likelihood, this book has its inaccuracies - so if only a part of it is true, it paints an extremely alarming picture of or country's leadership. The US is effectively rudderless. The fact that Trump achieved precious little in his first year (except for his executive orders to undo as much of Obama's legacy as possible - something definitely uncreative) means that the book is rather flat, with the same themes maintaining throughout (ie the battles between `Jarvanka` and Bannon for control of the White House). Nonetheless, it illustrates well that we have a President who is narcissistic, attention seeking, childish, inarticulate, prone to tantrums and desperately seeking respect (but not getting any for obvious reasons). So much for draining the swamp; this bunch of clowns are trying to install another political dynasty (like the Kennedys, the Bushes and the Clintons - just an ignorant version). The book illustrates well the over arching sense of entitlement that these sorts of people have. It's not about MAGA, it's all about benefiting the Trump clan (nothing else).

There should not be any surprise here . . .this is has been his personality dating back over thirty years. Itâ€™s regrettable that his legacy will be something that all his children and grandchildren will have to endure throughout their lifetimes. On the other hand,  our country is strong enough and will exit this rather dark chapter of our history in a much better place.",January-7-2018,5

6629,"I too wasn't going to buy the book, thinking I would get the majority of its content from the almost constant new coverage.  But also like others here, I couldn't resist driving up sales just a bit more after Trump's ham-handed attempt at censorship.  I purchased it, sent it to my Paperwhite and my family's devices.  I couldn't wait to get home and start reading, so I also downloaded it to the Kindle app on my phone.  Just so far reading the prologue about Ailes and Bannon, I can tell it's going to be difficult to put down this book.",January-5-2018,5

6635,After watching all the news reports about the book I thought about purchasing the book but then I changed my mind thinking the news has already covered the best parts of the book. When Donald Trump didnâ€™t want it to be sold to the public I knew I had to read the book. What is in the book that he doesnâ€™t want the public to know about.,January-5-2018,5
6636,Great book--fascinating!,January-10-2018,5
6637,This book is one of the best I have read. Mr Wolff brought out facts that made sense of the news we hear and I appreciate his hard work.  I have always said the guilty make the most noise of innocence.,January-11-2018,5
6638,Good book and gives an insight into the presidency.,April-23-2018,4
6639,Excellent book!I am both amazed and sickened that this man and his partners in crime are sitting in the White House making a mess of everything they touch.This book clearly shows what everyone has come to find out - This president is totally unfit for office by any measure.,January-5-2018,5

6642,"I read this book in 2 days - couldn't put it down.  While many claim it is fiction, it makes a lot of sense that there is drama between the West Wing factions - alt right, NY rich kids and Republican establishment - and the Trump profile is not at all surprising if you read his tweets and listen to his speeches.  A fascinating, well-written story of this incredible time in history.",January-11-2018,5

6650,"With all the spectacle and flair behind this book, whether it is true or not, this will be an accepted version of Truth and will probably result as the reference text for any film/television telling of the first Year of the Trump presidency. Undeniably entertaining, the book discusses Trumpâ€™s first year in the white house, but honestly it reads more like a series of TV episodes than it does a critical analysis of the West Wing and the figures present. There was a passage describing how nothing gets done because no one is skilled enough to do anything that read like a â€œCatch-22â€ù excerpt, which was great and hilarious, but at the same time made me question the realistic approach of the book. I think that my biggest with it is problem is that it, very much like the Trump presidency, is searching for some television like narrative, Wolff wants media attention, Wolff wants it to be viewed favorably. The ending passage sets the seen for a sequel, Bannon standing on the steps of Breitbart waiting for vengeance, Jarvanka thinking they have secure placement in the White House, and Trump ignorant and degenerating. The thing reads like it was made for TV, or worse and probably true, that our reality is now more akin to television shows than it is to real life and reality is constructed with a deep regard for television. Read it, but be very critical, because this is what will be regarded, as some type truth.So as much as it is a sensational, biased, probably shadily-researched, cash-and-fame-grab, it will be accepted as some type of truth in contemporary political discourse.",January-11-2018,3

6665,"Not like we did not know about this man. He is destroying this country with his lies, his child like brain, his ego, his lust for power and his in ability to be normal. If we have three more years of THIS we are doomed. I say in 2020 we MAKE AMERICA AMERICA AGAIN. Enough with the racism, the conspiracy theories, the hate, the abuse of power, the lies, the bragging, the fantasies, the hurting of the middle class and low income, and the CON that this president is TRYING so hard to push on us, the people. REMEMBER, WE THE POEPLE PAY taxes and this man WORKS FOR US. Yet he seems to think he works for HIM, and seems to want to build up his empire even further, while helping some buddies along the way. This book is a good read and just what I expected, as we can see our president every day and his behavior that we see, fits all in this book. So no real surprises to me but wow, it's good and I give it 5 stars.",January-5-2018,5

6667,"I bought the hard cover version of this book thinking it would be of sufficient quality to read it and then loan it to others. The quality is terrible. It looks like it was printed on a cheap laser printer that was running out of toner. For the first hundred pages there are swaths of faint to barely visible  text running top to bottom on every page. It makes reading difficult and less enjoyable. I don't know if this is just my copy or if the entire run of books was like this, but I am really not happy with it.",January-30-2018,2

6669,"Very well written. When you read it you remember many of the public tales and dramas as well as word for word public Trump rants.

6671,"Like many others, I only purchased this book because Trump didn't want it published. I've only read through chapter 3, BUT for anyone who follows the news none of the ""revelations"" should surprise you. While some of the claims may seem outlandish, much of what this administration does is outlandish, plus if it truly is a work of fiction, why would the White House try so hard to suppress it?Overall an interesting read so far.",January-7-2018,5

6684,I think Wolff gets a few facts wrong but  he's on point in demonstrating the overall incompetence in the white house. It's clear trump is running his administration in the same way he ran his businesses which explains the bankruptcies.,January-7-2018,5

6696,"Other than what might be a somewhat tidy organization of the Trump White House chaos, this book might be an example of the worst writing ever. Wolff doesn't know sentence structure. He doesn't know punctuation. Does his publishing company hire any editors? What about proofreaders? Even if you are game to get this so-called inside story, reading it is so difficult due to the poor quality that it took me several weeks to plow through it. Full disclosure: I'm an editor by trade, and I'm embarrassed for my colleagues by this book. As for the story: well, there's not much there we don't already know. I'm not sure Wolff even does much to connect the dots. Yep, there's chaos, people are characters, people get fired, and time marches on. This copy won't remain on my bookshelf, I'm reselling or donating it immediately.",February-15-2018,2

The president is not dictator of America and it's our patriotic duty to remind him of that fact.The book itself has some juicy details regarding the president's shenanigans and sheer stupidity from his first year in office. I will say however that it definitely should be proofread more, there are a lot of run-on sentences with too many commas and numerous grammar errors that should be looked at. Other than that, I'd recommend this for anyone wanting to know more about what's going on with this nightmare of a presidency or to just give him the middle finger for trying to shut this publication down.",January-7-2018,5

6707,"Great informative book. Enjoyable. And appropriately terrifying AND  amusing. For someone who follows events relatively closely but not obsessively, the book seems factual,Trump whiners and sycophants notwithstanding. 22 1/2 chapters were EXCELLENT,but the last half of the Epilogue dropped the rating from 5 stars (maybe even SIX stars on a scale of 5!) down to 4. Too much speculation there and too much content suggesting a plan to re-launch Bannon's career. History and explanation- superb. Prediction -meh. Niehls Bohr made the observation,later attributed to Yogi Berra  to the effect that  predicting anything is difficult,ESPECIALLY the future! Apparently, Henry Holt  & Co. has too many English majors and not enough Quantum Physicists  or baseball catchers on their editorial staff. BUT, overall,a superb book.",January-11-2018,4

6715,I love this book.  And I am 110% convinced it is 110% accurate.  Thank you Michael Wolff for publishing!  Trump will next want to send the military into everyoneâ€™s home to confiscate this book and burn them in the streets.  The Dotard is going down!,January-5-2018,5

6718,It re-enforced my thoughts on how President Trump and his White House operates.  I did feel the book was written so it could read as fictionalized.,January-17-2018,3

6724,No citations to hard fact. Reads like a stormy novel,March-7-2018,1
6725,"The book had a real feeling of being rushed to print, including typos.I believe every story in the book, it's jar dropping. I think the pacing and the repetition of things needed to be tightened up a lot so it didn't end up beating us over the head with the same point repeatedly.That said, everybody should read this book if they voted or intend to vote in the future.",January-14-2018,3

6727,"There is nothing in this book that you could not infer from reading 45's tweets, watching the news, watching late night, reading books about the 2016 campaign, and generally reading the daily scandals that pour out of this administration. Having what you assume pretty much confirmed is satisfying... but here... it's also pretty horrifying. It was well written and feels true but it's a lot to take in all at once.",January-9-2018,4

6734,"What makes this book great is all of the strange episodes we have followed coming out of the White House we now know what was going on behind the scenes. Wolff became an invisible fixture on the couch who was able to interview anyone he wanted in the West Wing because they all believed he belonged there. Trump's ego gets him in trouble again, as usual.",January-17-2018,5
6735,"I purchased this book mostly because President Trump tried to suppress it, and I just couldnâ€™t wait in line for weeks for a copy to become available at my local library. Then had to wait for weeks anyway because the publisher seriously underestimated the demand.The copy editing for this book is the worst Iâ€™ve ever seen. Modern word processing software should have corrected most of the errors, and just having one person proofread it would have made a world of difference.The author used way too many words that even well educated and well read people will likely need to look up in a dictionary. This disrupted the flow of my reading and took away from the experience.Now all that said, I still found the book very entertaining and even though most of the story was already well known before the book was published, I still got a few good laughs out of it.",February-12-2018,4

6741,"As an avid follower of the daily news surrounding the Trump presidency, I found this book fit all the pieces together. As I recalled the shocking and disturbing events of Trump's first year, this book illustrated the behind-the-scenes interaction of Trump's staff, the press, and his ""billionaires sounding board"". With a much more complete understanding of Trump's troubled history and profound incompetence, I am surprisingly more at ease realizing the ""Emperor"" truly ""has no clothes"".",January-14-2018,5

6749,"Five stars to Wolff for being willing to report what others are not (or cannot, because they do not possess his journalistic instincts).Why are others not willing to report in such detail, as he has?  It is because they are afraid that no one would believe them. And this is a legitimate concern, because few in this country (even those who detest Trump) want to believe what is happening every day in this White House.  Perhaps Wolff's work (and extensive notes and tapes) will inch us closer to the reality.But all will still have difficulty accepting that it really could be this bad.  A constant, subtle strain of denial, disbelief, and looking the other way is the norm.  Why is this?There is one thing Americans are immensely naive about: mental illness in general, and the particularly common category called the personality disorder.  Few understand how widespread the various varieties are and how dangerous they can be (at work, at home, in relationships).  Instead, they are afraid of them (like mental illness in general) and look away.  They just don't want to accept that someone they thought they knew is not at all what they thought.The excuses and rationalizations are endless: ""He must have a good reason."" ""She's just a little upset."" ""It must have been something I said."" ""I'll just explain things and everything will be okay.""  We want to look the other way, completely unwilling to accept the bad news: that this is no longer a rational person with good intentions, someone capable of being self-aware, someone who will ever change.  We deny the damage being done, to ourselves, our careers, or our families, until it is too late and the damage is final.  And it is often catastrophic and irreversible.They are in all walks of life.  Many of those with the most severe personality disorders are your boss, or CEO of your company.  Many of them function well in certain roles, for a time, until their behaviors eventually cause them to self-destruct, but only after inflicting destruction on others.  And they take down those who ""believe"" in them, exhaust themselves defending them, who play along as if all of it is perfectly normal and rational, with just ""a few bumps in the road"".  These are the blind, the ones who hope that something good can come out of it -- something, anything -- until the roof caves in.Ultimately, this is not just about Trump.  It's about a bigger reality that involves millions of people: those with the disorders (and are roaming free), and those affected by them.  Every day, and often for a lifetime.I have some personal experience with this.  My family was in complete denial that it had such a problem on its hands.  All were subjected by one family member to regular screaming fits, paranoid accusations, and outrageous acts, over and over and over again.  We all wondered what we could do to help, assumed this person was otherwise ""normal"", and tried to tip-toe around it.  Absolutely nothing helped.  In fact, it got worse.  After decades of this, someone finally uttered the dreaded words: ""It's a difficult thing to have mental illness in the family.""  Everything changed for the better at that moment.As a companion read to Wolff's book, I strongly recommend another.  Without it, it is nearly impossible to appreciate what Wolff is reporting.  Written by a recognized expert in the field specifically for everyday people, it's calledÂ Difficult Personalities: It's Not You; It's Them.  Key point: they may not be in a mental institution, but that doesn't mean there isn't a serious problem that will bring great pain.  And you have to protect yourself.I wish I had read this book 40 years ago.  It would have saved me tremendous hardship in dealing with many people over the years.  And I think it will do the same for any reader.Do not look away.  Look directly at the problem.  Then admit there is a problem.  A very big one.  And it's not going to just ""get better"".  This is what Wolff is pointing to.  Compared to that, the details almost don't matter.",January-7-2018,5

This was the most disturbing passage for me, but hardly surprising.Overall, I found the book a pretty quick and entertaining read chronicling the Shakespearean tragedy masquerading as the US government featuring a Trump-Bannon-Jarvanka blood feud with gossipy tidbits from asserted courtiers thrown in.Although readers should take this book with a grain of salt, it does support reporting of Trump's dysfunctional personality on general unsuitability for the job while hinting at his possible dyslexia or semi-literacy.Personally, I thought Luke Harding's 'Collusion' much more revelatory.",January-11-2018,3

In fact, with the news cycle and Trump News at present, the book was outdated two days after it was published.

For me, this book is an illuminating reminder of why I volunteer as often as possible. It's well-written: anyone seeing me reading would wonder why my eyes occasionally pop, why a book would make me roll my eyes and shake my head or why I'm sputtering with laughter (it's often a choice of bursting into tears or laughing - laughing is better for my health).

6799,"If you've been reading the news, then there aren't too many surprises in Michael Wolff's transcript of the clash of the Trump and Bannon egos. Bannon was a political arsonist who eveyone knew would burn his bridges when he left the White House. And in exchange for the access to the White House Wolff had gotten during Bannon's tenure, Wolff has written a book exclusively from Bannon's perspective. The book's only redeeming feature is to give an inside look, though seen from Bannon's perspective, at the complete disfunction of the Trump White House and an explanation: the dysfunction is intentional. Trump thrives on conflicts between subordinates. And in the period covered by Wolff, the three teams in conflict were Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner (derisively called Jarvanka by Bannon and Wolff), former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and finally Bannon. If you want the perspectives of Mattis, McMaster, Kelly or Tillerson, you will have to wait on another book, which is sure to come.",January-7-2018,3

He captures in 5 letters what it would take others three sentences to write) and then I think:  ""When do I laugh at this?""  So I go and read something else and come back later.  I suppose that is the beauty of a Kindle.  As crazy as this makes me feel, I gotta give props to Steve Bannon.  He is quoted in here and he didn't deny it.

I would certainly recommend it to all Americans, and most especially to people who donâ€™t obsessively follow political news. That said, it loses a star because it suffers from uneven editing. Iâ€™d give that a harsher penalty if the timeliness of the release werenâ€™t such a big issueâ€”the action in the book ended a few months before the release, and it surely was better to get it out now than to keep perfecting it.",January-7-2018,4

The Trump White House really is a Reality Show come to life, and Michael Wolff has done an incredible job of putting us right in the middle of the action. Definitely an incredible read, and while most of the accounts the author includes  I knew somewhat intuitively, it is amazing to see it confirmed in print so clearly and, in bizarre and frightening fashion.  I also commend the author for introducing us to the main characters in the White House, and giving us a glimpse into their history and motivations and why they made the decisions they made.  And Steve Bannon. What a character! His politics repulse me, but I definitely feel like I would have loved to talk to him over a few beers and some really bad Chinese Food.  He is the star of this Book for sure. Also, Scaramucci (THE MOOCH) section, while short, is fantastic.  We need the Mooch to come back on the show. He is a real ratings winner.Side note:  If the author's conclusions are correct, (and I am pretty sure they are)  yesterday's DACA meeting was all Jarvanka (Jared and Ivanaka)-trying to make the Liberals happy so they will lay off the Russia investigation.  I am certain those Jamos (Gotta love Bannon's slang) were cooking up another plot to save their skin while sinking Trump deeper into the swamp.To end, you HAVE to read this book.  It puts you on in the middle of the best reality show I have ever seen.",January-8-2018,5

6872,An entertaining and informative work that paints a credible if not disturbing portrait of our 45th President. Every crazy Trump tweet and unbalanced action that the president takes actually supports what Wolff wrote. You really get to understand why Trump is the worst president in our lifetimes.,January-11-2018,5
6873,"For Anti-Trump people: I could not put it down and read it non-stop for 12 hrs.  It's hugely entertaining, kept me smiling and laughing for hours.For Trump Supports:  You will not enjoy this book.  I did not enjoy ""Clinton Cash"".For middle of the road people: This is a must read book.  So many interesting and socking details revealed.  Watch the changes that will happen because of this book.",January-7-2018,5
6874,"I like the fact that the author brought a lot of things to light, but what I really really didn't like is the fact that all of the writing was done with unsupported hearsay! I really feel that this was just more partisan politics to try to drive a wedge between the presidency and those that support them!",March-8-2018,1
6875,I found the book interesting. Supported my theory that sometimes policy/tweets for the sole reason to piss off Liberals. Steve Bannon is evil incarnate.

6878,"This administration reminds me so much of the Peter Sellers movie, BeingThere. Where a gardener is mistakingly seen as a the genius that the king makers are looking for.Fire and fury, I thought consists chiefly of the interactions of those in the West Wing. I donâ€™t know how other administrators stack against the present one,  but my experience in academia suggests that the knives are always out.",January-11-2018,4

I never had that problem with a book before.  The pages look like they are cheesy paper.

6885,Just bought this book because Iâ€™m not going to have some bumblehead take away my 1st amendment rights.  Iâ€™m a proud American and this is my country that my forefathers fought for to provide our freedoms. Way to go Michael Wolff for enlightening the unenlightened.,January-7-2018,5
6886,"This book confirms my worst fears - the Trump White House is in chaos, and no one has the guts to confront the man who is supposed to be the President. Wolff has a breathless style of writing that took some getting used to (so many dashes!), but I was intrigued by what he has to say.",January-7-2018,5
6887,Sad to admit we were duped. Trump should be impeached.the sooner the better. America can and must do better. Our democracy depends on it.,February-16-2018,5

6889,Very difficult to read,February-28-2018,1
6890,"Glad I bought the kindle version. I couldn't wait for the hard copy. It's worth buying and further verifies what we've all been thinking. After Trump tried to halt this book, it made me want it all the more.",January-6-2018,5
6891,After seeing the author interviewed a number of times I believe this was much more just his opinion and possibly not based totally on fact. I find Michael Wolff to be no more believable than Donald Trump.,March-12-2018,1
6892,Disappointed. Full of innuendo and gossip. Editors should be flogged for all the errors they let by. Also someone needs to tell the author that he doesnâ€™t need to use ten dollar words to try and make the book seem credible.,January-17-2018,3
6893,"There are so many excerpts being thrown around the media that you really don't *need* to buy this book. But you should still do it. It's a fun, breezy, outrageous read about an appalling bunch of people and your reading it will annoy them.",January-5-2018,5
6894,"I'm not a Trump supporter, but I didn't go searching for this book to find ""evidence"" to support my personal feelings about him. I actually searched for this book out of curiosity. Several morning shows were talking about the book so I was aware of it, but when Trump was trying very hard to keep it from being published, I thought it warranted a closer look.The book itself reads like a thrilling political television series with a lot of twists and turns. That can be fun for some, but it made things a bit confusing for me. I wrote down a few side notes so I could make sure I was understanding every character and what was being said. This is a common style of writing for a book like this and there's nothing wrong with the style itself; I simply had to read it more slowly. I also rarely need a dictionary reference for books, but I did with this one. There are words both of a political nature and a very articulate nature that I had to double check on.Overall, it is an interesting story. It answered some questions that I had about Trump and his White House that either hadn't been answered before or that people simply wouldn't answer at all. These answers should count towards the validity of the book, but for all it divulges, there is still a lot left unsaid. Obviously, Wolff was not around at all times and could not answer everything.It is hard to put this book into perspective as a non-fiction about an actual American President who will go down in our Nation's history for all of time as one of our many Commanders in Chief. It reads more like a fast-paced, fictional account that someone could easily turn into a film or TV series and pitch it as a psychological mystery-thriller with an ambiguous ending that never lets us know exactly what the hell just happened and leaves us wanting more. We're not sure if our favorite characters are actually who we believe they are, or if the ones at the top are truly bad guys or a result of a series of unfortunate events and a faulty system.Since all of the book is based on interviews, point-of-view perspectives and direct quotes re-hashed from Trump's television appearances, I took all of the information from a neutral standpoint. It's the best way to read this book because you can easily get lost trying to separate solid fact from the appearance of fact. This is not to say that Wolff is lying. I believe he knew that this book would be heavily inspected upon release and he did the best he could to make it as perfect as humanly possible to avoid Trump's wrath. There are simply many things divulged through the lens of personal biases from the person speaking. There is no way to know for certain if what they are saying is absolute truth or what they think is the truth.I would not recommend this book for Trump supporters. If you are looking for something positive about him in any sense of the word, this is not the book for you. This was a bit of a concern for me because I do like books that tell both sides of a story. People both real and fictional are best when they are layered and it adds some validity to a story when there is more than one perspective. This is definitely a book where Trump is the primary antagonist, but it also appears that all those who surround him are antagonists in their own way. There are no heroes in this version of America.This book explores the modern struggle of Americans and the division of our country. It also explores what happens when someone with money and influence makes the choice to do something just to say they could and not because they really wanted to do it. There's a certain level of uncertainty that comes from that revelation. This book unearths a series of potential consequences that have happened and that could happen based on this choice. This book also leads readers to wonder how well we the people truly understand what goes on at the top.",January-30-2018,3
6895,"Read this as an act of defiance, first & foremost, against an uninformed & unfit chief executive who believes he should be able to control the narrative. Read it for the delicious layers of dirt upon dirt. But most of all, read it to understand what it is we must dedicate ourselves as a nation to making sure never happens again.",January-5-2018,5
6896,"While putting the events of the past year in an easy-to-read narrative has its merits, there really is nothing new here which hasn't already been reported on or couldn't be inferred by Trump's own words through tweets and speeches.",January-16-2018,3
6897,Wolff tries to take in many different realities (too many from Bannon) and compile them into one picture.  An amazing feet and Iâ€™m sure he tried his best with what he could find.,January-22-2018,4
6898,"I was afraid of Trump and his administration before I read this book.  Now I petrified/terrified.  He's crashing and burning this past week.  I don't think he read the book, he doesn't read.  But he was read to or told by his staff.  Love the time cover of his first year!",January-11-2018,5
6899,"...this book will give you nightmares.  Wolffâ€™s depiction of the West Wing in the early days of the current administration paints a grotesque picture of infantile behavior, unabashed power struggles and unfettered egos, almost wholly detached from any sense of normalcy (or even reality), resulting in supreme chaos, dangerous impulsivity, and national humiliation.",January-11-2018,5
6900,"Data somewhat suspect.  Not sure reading has enhanced my understanding of anything.  If anything, seems bit sleazy; however I'm not in any position to pass judgement on validity.  Wouldn't purchase again based on reading it once.",February-11-2018,2

6903,"Sad course of events. Worst fears confirmed at every page turn. Informative and really what does one do with this?!  Patience, patience. karma.",January-17-2018,4
6904,It is an interesting book and gives the public an insight into the White House.  The public now has confirmation on what many reporters have been told privately.  Michael Wolff has access to the President and his staff.  It has made 2018 a much year!!!!,January-7-2018,5
6905,"I think it had the meanness and slant of a gossip column. Much of the information that would lead one to make conclusions about the President's faults is already available to the public from reading tweets, listening to speeches and reading reports about his past. The interviews he did with Steve Bannon were revealing. I learned why the President's hair is sometimes orange! I would not recommend the book.",February-7-2018,2

6907,"You're going to tell me what I can and cannot read? Sorry, Donnie.",January-7-2018,4
6908,"First of all....this book was obsolete the moment it hit the stores. One simply cannot keep up with the daily shenanigans of this administration. And I found Wolff's writing style difficult to read. He must have had a thesaurus on his desk so that he could take the most simple words and turn them into words not many people use in everyday life. Thank goodness my kindle has a built in dictionary. After seeing him on several TV morning shows, I can only imagine he chose this writing style to make himself seem credible and intelligent, it failed. I also found myself skipping whole chapters due to the boring subject matter. I would pick the book up from time to time, only to put it back down out of boredom.",March-7-2018,1
6909,A great read. The author really captures the chaos and disarray of the Trump administration.,January-11-2018,5

6912,It reads like fiction except it isn't. Found it well written and witty. One can sense where embellishments are added.  Overall it really brings home just how completely dysfunctional our entire political system is as a whole.  It connects the dots to the new swamp that resides under the guise of alt right.,January-11-2018,5

6915,I bought this because someone in power tried to stop me from reading it. When if not now do we the people regain our country. Why do we permit someone so unstable to continue to erode and endanger our country. I implore all those who can make a difference step up and save our country from further damage!  We deserve better and we expect more from those we elect to serve us not their sponsors.,January-5-2018,5
6916,"Important window into the chaos and motivations in the WH.  No surprises, or help, but definitely worth the time.  All moderates who understand how our government is supposed to work, should read.  It is so easy to scapegoat any one of the movers in the play, but dangerous to ignore the broader picture illustrated here.",January-7-2018,5
6917,The book reinforces many of the impressions I had from newspapers and TV. It was a good read and my rating of 3 out of 5 is due the fact that I didn't find much new here.,January-10-2018,3
6918,"Let me say I think DJT, his family, his henchmen and his billionaire cohorts are the worst kind of human excrement possible.That said, I bought this book before  it was published ,it never lived up to its hyperbole. There are no sources sited. Just hear-say and casual observations and opinion. It's jammed packed with breathless run on sentences.

It doesn't say anything you don't already know.If you follow the news everyday don't waste your money.We are screwed folks.",February-14-2018,1
6919,"Reluctantly, I finished the book to spite Trump. Anyone who follows the daily news could finish writing each chapter. By the book's end it was Bannon's story.

6992,Try to keep an open mind and take everything with a grain of salt from this view of the current presidency. I'm glad this work is available.,January-5-2018,5
6993,"First, I would like to congratulate Michael Wolff on a well-written, in-depth and honest view of the White House and for giving the american people a small glimpse into the circus and circus performers that work within the White House walls everyday!  In my opinion, Mr. Wolff did an excellent job in the verbal presentation for  people that purchased the book in audio and not hard cover and I, as most people, am shocked by what I read and can only hope that the name calling and sloppy work that goes on in the White House and in particular, the Oval Office will disappear and a healthier, more equitable and secure government will emerge.",January-11-2018,5
6994,This book does a wonderful job in shedding light on the various characters and personalities that compromise the Trump Administration. It also gives a very interesting take of the inner workings of the White House and the rationale of each decision and action taken by DJT in the first 3/4 of year one.,January-17-2018,5
6995,"This doesnâ€™t seem a de facto account of White House events, but certainly provides more color on events to date.",January-7-2018,4

7001,I have no intention of reading this book-he sickens me. But I do want it to be a best seller.,January-6-2018,5
7002,"This book isn't really about trump.  It is about the circus of, crippled by their vast level of unqualification, people he has trying to run the country for him.",January-7-2018,5
7003,About what I expected. Trump is an idiot and a psychopath and this book confirms it.  Hope we can survive him.,January-17-2018,4
7004,"Confirms what apparently ~ 65% of voters think about Trump, rings true.  Hard to read with the constant qualifiers, descriptors  inserted mid-sentence.",January-11-2018,3

7008,"Not through it yet. Much like the news these days, I can only take it in small bits. Itâ€™s just too depressing. But it is entertaining on the surface. Nothing I am reading surprises me so far and I am certain the best bits are all over the news anyway, but I felt the need to purchase it when 45 tried to suppress it. So .. there ya go.",January-6-2018,5

7012,Is there anything written in here that much of a surprise? Would definitely recommend! 5/5 stars! Would definitely read again!,January-7-2018,5

7015,"Interesting, insightful, yet scary.",January-14-2018,5
7016,"""Fire & Fury"" (aka ""The Fired & the Furry"" based on the cast of characters) is amazing. I'm 2/3 of the way through, and this is absolutely the best slasher-horror-comedy (of errors ...so many errors) I've ever read. ""The Fired"" come off very badly, but ""the Furry"" (aka the Orange Dumpster, with, according to Wolff/Ivanka, a ring of fur around an inadvertent tonsure) comes off far, far worse. And of course the Not-Yet-Fired are enjoyably skewered too.Okay, so Michael Wolff has some known accuracy issues -- but even he can't make all of this stuff up. And regardless of whether only a sizable amount rather than most of it turns out to be true (or truthy), this really *is* the presidential biography/administration coverage classic of our times, and possibly the one that America deserves. We are, after all, embarrassingly enough, a country where a large part of the population believes Fox ""News"" and Limbaugh and Breitbart (and doesn't seem to believe in NPR/PBS, evolution, or climate change) -- so then, who better than the grand-standing and prone-to-confabulating Wolff to chronicle the posturing and falsehoods of President Dumpster and the, ah, trials and tribulations (may they be many) of his administration?So get your hands on a (library) copy of this now, and you'll be more entertained and/or horrified -- for longer! -- than when you first lost half a day to Angry Birds, or were just about crying because of the video of that starving polar bear.Grade: A (non-fiction and/or fiction); would read the sequel.",January-6-2018,5
7017,I don't like the author's writing style of long rambling sentences with too many commas or his unnecessarily obscure vocabulary as if at one point he was forced to memorize a thesaurus.Other than that this book is so far deliciously juicy and I can't put it down. It's also driving him batshit crazy. That alone is worth 5 stars.,January-6-2018,5
7018,I couldnâ€™t wait to receive this book but I was disappointed almost from page 1. It is hugely over-rated and over-anticipated. I thought it was poorly written and not at all engaging.  I had to reread sentences over and over to understand them because of the poor sentence structure. Donâ€™t waste your money.,January-25-2018,2
7019,Subject material interesting but you need a dictionary  to read it as his use of words is way above the average readers vocabulary....,February-4-2018,2
7020,"Recommended for getting details about the trump white house. Flow is good, and detailed list of events tlover the past year",February-16-2018,4
7021,Very  disappointed.  Wasted $15.,March-8-2018,1
7022,This book pulls back the curtains a bit and lays bare some horrifying but simple truths in the words of Trump's own inner circle.,January-5-2018,5
7023,Cheap tabloid gossip.,March-7-2018,1
7024,"Lol, trying to ban books.  Backfired, eh?  Anyways, book is great.",January-6-2018,5
7025,"I haven't read the novel yet but as a patriot I felt it was my duty to protect the Constitution and the 1st Amendment that this great nation was founded on!!!I will give my honest opinion of the novel once I've read it over the weekend.Long live the United States and what it stands for, ""United We Stand"" divided we fall!",January-5-2018,5
7026,"Poorly written, I didn't like the writing style. Also, all the good bits have already come out in the media.  However it does give a pretty good sense of how chaotic things in the White House were in the first year.",January-11-2018,3
7027,"I bought this to support free speech and in protest of Trump's efforts to prevent its publication. Someday this book will serve as a lens into one of the darkest periods in American history, and people will reflect on how our rights were systematically whittled away and how creeping normalization made things that were once unthinkable part of our daily conversations (the president calling neo nazis ""very fine people"", tweeting nuclear threats, and the rest of it). For now though, this is just an opportunity to taste a smattering of the zeitgeist and share the more absurd and insane anecdotes with folks that probably already agree with you. Nevertheless, it's bound to be interesting. Enjoy!",January-5-2018,5
7028,Loved it!!!!!!!! A must read for every American!,January-11-2018,5
7029,"Was happy to get this.  Price was less than the advertised, pre order price.",February-17-2018,5
7030,"Like many who have purchased this book, I would not have thought to buy this book if it did not become a banned book this last week. Not sure how far I'll get into the book, I have gotten great cliff notes from the media. DT has always wanted a reality show and he has it written in the form of a book. I am happy to support this author and keep this book on the best seller list. This book is as important to the resistance as ""What Happened?"" In fact, this is a great sequel and should have been entitled, ""THIS is What Happened!"" I wish HRC recorded the Audio Book.",January-5-2018,5
7031,"There are so many typos, and it really distracts me from the message heâ€™s trying to convey. Iâ€™m gonna try to read it all the way through, but heâ€™s really not a good writer... You would think that his editor would have been able to point out his typos, grammatical errors, and awkward-sounding sentences.",January-25-2018,3
7032,"For someone who follows happenings in American politics in the Trump era the book does not offer much that is new. It does confirm ones view that the person in chief and those who come and go at his will are mostly a disturbed bunch. The low level language used by many from top down as recorded in the book gives a feel for the personalities they are. That is my takeawy from the book. The author quotes many of Trumps ramblings but obviously do not know what they indicate. Several are text book examples of a certain condition. Any one to offer a guess. Like the Memo that recently came out, not up to the hype.",February-3-2018,2
7033,"Honestly, it was more depressing than titillating. He is as bad as we thought. There is no genius (evil or otherwise) lurking in those ill-fitting suits.  Just a narcissist with dementia. Can't wait for November 2018. I would tell you to just read the excerpt in NY Magazine but I am sure every copy sold irks Trump, so buy it!!!",January-14-2018,3

7039,Trump didn't want anyone to buy this book. So I bought it as soon as it was released.,January-5-2018,5
7040,A tough read. I would not bother.,March-28-2018,1
7041,It is unbearably ill written. Bored me stiff.,March-14-2018,1
7042,"[Interesting how my original review was deleted... Ok, Amazon.]  4 stars because Wolff could have used an even more unflattering picture of Senor Orange Babyhands on the cover.1. The events and personalities in this book are just as horrific as you thought they were. (Keep in mind that some of the events and characterizations may have been embellished)2. There's so many horrible villains that I can't decide who I detest the most. Probably 45 as the winner with a three-way tie between Bannon, Conway, and Jarvanka for second place.3. This gem: ""Hicks, sponsored by Ivanka and ever loyal to her, was in fact thought of as Trump's real daughter, while Ivanka was thought of as his REAL WIFE,"" (Chapter 15).4. Bonus: ""Bannon, the supposedly publicity-shy man, was eating up the camera. He was a country music star - he was Johnny Cash,"" (Chapter 9). This is by far, one of the most eggregious comparisions Wolff makes. Don't disrespect Johnny.5. Are we living in an authoritarian dictatorship yet? Because I don't have an outfit for that.",January-5-2018,4

7047,"While this book is gossipy and tabloidish, it is an accurate portrayal of the essence of the Trump White House as evidenced by news accounts as well as public statements and actions of the administration. An entertaining read.",January-7-2018,5
7048,"A fascinating read. This guy was almost part of the furniture in the White House for about a year. There's no way that he could have anything other than a deep insight into what goes on there. If this were complete rubbish as some say, then, of course, it wouldn't need such vehement denials and legal posturing to attempt to block its publication.",January-7-2018,5
7049,The book does confirm the leaks and who the primary leakers were in the early days of the Administration.  I'm not sure if in the end it wasn't a book so much about Trump as it was Bannon.  The book does depict a President who seems to have just mentally checked out of a job he knows he can't do and did nothing to stop the wars of the staffers.  Family members who can't see beyond their own entitlement and arrogance.  A Steve Bannon who decided that the Breitbart agenda was going from thought to reality and a President who mentally is just not there.  At the end I just decided we're screwed as no one is looking out for We the People.,January-7-2018,4
7050,"This was my first audio book. I got it free for an introductory free month trial from Audible. I'm not in love with the way the narrator reads it. I wish he read it a little straighter. Sometimes he adds inflection for a particular person speaking (i.e., Bannon) that I don't think is necessary. I am enjoying the content however.",January-11-2018,3

Will not make any difference to the baskets of others Who  Tune Out reality in favor of Fox. Can bet trump won't read it But we'll certainly tweet about it. My only disappointment is that Michael could not in his last chapter detail the impeachment and ouster Of that idiot,January-7-2018,5
7054,See above. The book almost as bad as the president & his staffers. You already know everything in the book.,February-10-2018,2
7055,Overuse of scholarly words forcing readers to google the dictionary for assistance in understanding his text. Rambling sentences that exhausted the readers were his style of communication.The content was fun but the execution was painful. It took me twice as long to read this book because I would have to revisit every other paragraph,January-19-2018,2

7057,"The self proclaimed ""very stable genius"" is not going to censor my reading. I heard/read plenty of excerpts in the news so could have skipped buying. But once trump wanted to block release, I immediately bought it on Kindle. The president is as big a joke, if not worse, than I feared.",January-6-2018,5
7058,I am finding this book interesting but a slow read and will be giving my copy to a friend as a birthday present.,January-11-2018,5
7059,"I suspect that virtually everyone reading this book is is looking for some relief after a year of misery. My problem with this book is the author's fixation on the comma. It's as if his comma key was stuck on repeat while he slid words between. Virtually every sentence is a run-on. It's so distracting that I don't enjoy reading it. I'm hoping to get some pleasure by reading about the Divider In Chief, but I sure wish this author were a good writer.",January-17-2018,2
7060,"With all the hoopla, I was initially reluctant to read this. The reviews I read and heard on tv seemingly left little need to do my own reading.

7065,"The subject is fascinating, however the author is a terrible writer. I consider myself well educated and well read, yet I constantly had to refer to the dictionary due to the author's constant use of overly pompous words. Was he trying to prove his own intelligence?

7072,"The history of Trump's first year in office has been followed by most Americans who have any level of interest in politics. Wolff had an opportunity to put this disaster in writing- a writing that any serious observer would want to add to their ""reference"" library.  Wolff failed- poor editing, overuse of a thesaurus, convoluted sentence structure and frequently leaving the reader wondering if statements made are Wolff's opinions or simply his ideas of what were thoughts of a person or group he has written about.  There are some interesting bits in this book but it took work getting through Wolff's poor writing to get to the bits.",January-17-2018,2

7078,couldn't hold my attention...especially cautious as to what I was reading is true or false or emblished,February-8-2018,2
7079,"This work to me seemed like more than a timeline of events covering the period within which Wolff had been given West Wing access. That the timeline was extruded with often sourceless hearsay makes it a bedfellow with a 14 year oldâ€™s diary. I learned little that was new, except for the seedier alleged â€œconversationsâ€ù with the major and minor players. Reading it made me depressed with the realization that the majority party and its henchmen in DC right now wouldnâ€™t know the truth or respect it if it pushed them down the stairs.",January-17-2018,2
7080,Great read I knew the WH was in disarray but not to that extent in the book.  All I can say is get that jerk out of office with all of his cronies and start anew. It is our only chance to recapture the world's view of Americans.,January-10-2018,5
7081,"Other than the fact that Trump's own staff and family have  joined the majority of America in thinking that he  is a total buffoon, and Steve Bannon kisses and tells, the book breaks no other new ground. Anyone with half a brain could have deduced much of what is in this book by closely watching the Trump White House in action over the past year. It is a truly appalling administration, with a total ignoramus at the helm supported by greedy, grasping, and inept family members and a coterie of really stupid and ignorant aides, best exemplified by Stephen Miller, an alt-right nothing burger raised to prominence by a momentary lapse in judgment of the American public, aided and abetted by Russian interference in our electoral process.The book is moderately  interesting and confirmatory of what many Americans have already deduced  from watching the debacle that is our current president transact his first year in office. While the book has many sloppy errors, they are, for the most part, deminimis in nature rather than substantive. The author does have a somewhat awkward writing style, but one quickly gets used to it, and the substantive details ring true, consistent with the nightmare that the reader has seen unfold in our country  over the past year.  A pox on the houses of those who voted for the bloviating buffoon who now occupies the oval office. God help America!",January-24-2018,4
7082,Just not interesting,February-15-2018,2
7083,"A very superficial treatment of the Trump presidency.  The best part was some background on the.personalities involved and how they came to know each other and the President.  I found this background interesting but the authorâ€™s analysis of critical eventsannoying and half baked guesses gained by watching as he admits, sitting in the lobby in the West Wing, people coming and going and occasionally exchanging gossip.",January-18-2018,2
7084,"I'm no Trump fan, but this book has problems.  The book was obviously rushed to print.  Several typos, e.g., ""Trump Towner"".  Some facts were wrong.  Dick Armey was never Speaker of the House.  Trump owned the ""Miss Universe"" pageant, not the ""Ms. Universe"" pageant.  Book needed a good fact checker before it went to print.

7089,I find the over use of injected thoughts within another thought annoying. The book also rambles on similar to the main character.,January-21-2018,2
7090,OK.  Not overly interesting.,March-15-2018,3
7091,The trump White House is worse than when we lived through the craziness! I thought this book would be hard to get through but it was not.  But as others said it is sad. Our country is seen as inept where opportunists can make policy to the detriment of billions. Where the crude is lauded as powerful and the educated expert is reviled as stupid.The character of the worst president in over 200 years is what almost half the people ignored to still vote for him. I still cannot understand it and so many are my friends and family.And the ongoing congress continues the craziness. Laws to protect citizens are being overturned to be replaced by freedom for the powerful to make more money. Will politics turn around or continue to spiral back in time to the hypocrisy and oppression of the past?,January-27-2018,4

7104,"Interesting to hear all that goes on behind the scenes, and whilst I am still baffled at how Donald Trump won the election, and has remained President one year on (not a great selling point for democracy), this book was written with substantial bias with a lot of Trump-bashing, a lot of it which I believe but I feel a large part of it is sensationalized (& it would seem that Michael Wolff has profited from the furore and publicity), which I feel has reduced credibility of the author - a shame.  Informative read but it is not on my list of recommendations.  Missing Obama and his sensibilities every day.",January-19-2018,3
7105,dull,February-27-2018,2
7106,"This appears to be a well researched and crafted book. Never in history has a president given such access by a writer. As a reviewer commented, ""even if  it is only 10% accurate, then it is good reading"". Trump's personality has been exposed by himself and again by this author. In the book, he comes off more as a cartoon character than he does in personal appearances (TV, etc.). If exposed to this same, degree, then every presidency  would make similar good reading. I like reading about all sides of public personalities so I give this book a 3-star grade for presenting this author's viewpoint but not for much else. The further you read, the more he aligns with the liberal media so there is no way this can be a complete and accurate picture (no more than if Trump or one of his family wrote a similar book). How many people gave the much researched book ""The Worst President in History"" a top score?...Not nearly enough. Michael Wolff did a good job on the book, unfortunately within a year it will slide onto the deeply discounted shelf just like all the books on the Clintons and Obamas.",February-3-2018,3

From trump finishing off a pint of haagen daaz and watching 3 tvs while eating a burger in bed, where it confirms stories we've been hearing that this president does not read - anything,  it's almost unfathomable that he is president of the most powerful country in the world.

The book would have been much more appealing (to the average reader) if it had been written in layman terms.

True or not true, I don't know, I figure there's a grain of truth in most things and that's what hooks readers into reading this kind of book. My low rating is mostly due to the poor writing style.

7161,"The author mightâ€™ve been more honest with a disclaimer: â€œThis book is based on a true story or stories.â€ù Still, he did a very gossipy and readable job of piecing together all the clues he gathered. That's why to me it's both non-fiction and fiction, for he admits he guessed at a lot of the ""truth"" behind the gossip. That's good tabloid journalism.So what we have is a book purporting to be non-fiction but based on loose facts, hearsay and a conglomeration of conversations chosen to support the authorâ€™s thesis of â€œTrump stinks!â€ù Wolff himself admits that he often â€œsettled on a version of events he believes to be trueâ€_. the almost samizdat sharing, or gobsmacked retelling, of otherwise private and deep-background conversations.â€ù  I love sentences like that!The author has an up on Trump in that both have a way with using direct talk. What Wolff has done is â€œtweetedâ€ù the weaknesses of President Trump into a catchy book. (That is a bit of sarcasm on Trump's Twitter habit!)Wolff has a set-in-cement agenda. If the â€œfactsâ€ù and hearsay support that agenda, then it is (likely) true. And it bears telling. For instance, there HAS TO BE a Russian link to the Trump campaign. And since the â€œfakeâ€ù media believes there is a Steele dossier, therefore itâ€™s worth telling as truth. And even if the facts support something positive about Trump, Wolff tries to turn it into a negative with an angle such as, â€œI canâ€™t believe this."" That makes the book's theme consistent.Perhaps you'll laugh here and there at all the absurdities of White House intrigue -- that reminds me of Mark Twainâ€™s more literary book, A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHURâ€™S COURT.",January-5-2018,5

It paints Trump as a weak-minded, empty suit with no guiding principles and no moral compass, easily influenced by the last person he spoke to or the last segment he watched on cable news. It reveals a disturbing shoot-from-the-hip style of decision-making that produced a litany of bad hires and misfires.Even if it's only 80% factual, I find it to be 100% plausible.

There are errors and contradictions here and there but the author warns you about that in the beginning of the book -- differences in views and/or recollections from people, or something along those lines.  It would be a funny read if it weren't about us but it's mostly a collection of hear-say and rumors that are strung together that re-enforces an image of the administration that most of America already holds.  I can't say that I learned anything worthwhile or that this book made anything better.  I guess that my issue with it.  It was what we expected or believed to be true anyway but when it's put down in writing -- regardless of any disclaimers -- people have a tendency to regard it as fact, or mostly fact.  I personally think that much of what's here is true and that's the issue.  It doesn't change anything about our situation but it feels like it weakens us an a country.

I would have appreciated a book that simply reported facts & let the reader draw his or her own conclusions without sensationalism. In addition I found his writing style unnecessarily verbose & dull. I did learn a little about Bannon; There was nothing new about Trump that we haven't already learned from the news. I question the author's authority. I'd be interested in his list of sources. Obviously many readers must agree with my opinion because I see the book, though I was persuaded to buy it by a glowing newspaper review, did not keep its spot as the top seller for very long.

He's a little too clever with (maybe showing off) fancy words he could just as easily replace with normal dialog -- making the book flow better. As for content... no surprises, I've pretty much heard it all via the media.

7241,"This is an interesting book, and it is very readable. People who have followed the trajectory of 45 will not have any real surprises. They will have their hunches about him, his White House, and his aides, confirmed.The author has several threads that he keeps weaving into the  narrative, each time couched in a bit different verbiage. He lets us know that 45 doesn't read, has no executive function, has a short attention span, and he thinks everybody should love him. Jarvanka  (Jared & Ivanka) are really Democrats in Republican clothing-and not Pat Nixon's cloth coat. The triad of Reince, Steve, and Jared all tried to ""handle"" 45, while they jockeyed for the top dog position. Steve Bannon tried to implement his agenda to dismantle the government. To be honest, this book is as much about Steve Bannon as it is about 45.  Michael Wolff gives a lot of detail.Given that it is readable, and the subject matter is mesmerizing, why did I give it three stars? There was too much repetition, and I felt that it was there to puff a slender book up. I did improve my vocabulary. There were several words that I had not encountered before. Who knew that an author could work the word Myrmidons into a narrative more than once?",January-6-2018,3
7242,"Bought this even despite listening to it on Audible.  Proud to let #45 know he canâ€™t suppress the 1st Amendment.  This is America.  We are free and our diversity is an integral part of our greatness.  Trump has dampened us but he canâ€™t extinguish us.This book coherently validates and chronicles the chaos within 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.  Remember Fire and Fury well in the hope that we never forget the fragility of freedom, dignity and the awesome power wielded by the US presidency. May it assist us in the arduous task of preventing history from repeating itself. #TheResistance",January-12-2018,5
7243,"I found this book to be lacking in substance and cohesive thought. It reads like a high school newsletter reporter who got reprinted  in the National Inquirer of the 1980â€™s. In the scheme of fascination, it still falls short. I was insulted by the low editing quality, which consists of randomly placed multisyllabic words, seemingly intended to create legitimacy, however, this tactic was so poorly executed, even it was distracting and obvious. This book lacks story, substance, and continuity. Donâ€™t waste your money. It is an overly hyped, poorly written, opportunistic marketing effort solely and at best.",January-31-2018,1

It is a book about maggots; maggots in a big pile trying to get to the top of a maggot heap.None of the maggots are interested in our county, our citizens, or even the â€˜top maggotâ€™ who is unable to formulate what it even means to be the â€˜topâ€™ maggot.If only 1/10 of the material in this book is true about how Washington works, I have lost interest in anything political.The only good thing I can say about this book is that it will save me from spending even one more minute of my life following or participating in politics which has become downright evil in the Biblical sense of the word.",January-7-2018,3
7248,"This is just a fantastic, fascinating, cannot put down read. Online there are suggestions that this is a book of fiction - however, the particular issues questioned by critics are minor. Writing that the president cannot work the light switches instead of that his aides cannot work the switches is one example. Or that Russia is blackmailing Trump rather that might be able to blackmail Trump.......who cares!  The important events described in this book have already been covered extensively in the news. I just think everyone in America should read this book. To say it has the ring of truth is an understatement.",January-7-2018,5

7258,"As Michael Wolff has admitted that none of his assertions or accusations can be verified, the book depends upon the readers hate for President Trump to carry it off.  This book will do nothing to make the Never Trumpers hate Trump more, nor will it convince Trumpers to lose their faith in the President.  The most interesting thing about the book is how unwittingly the dark side of the author is exposed.  Picture a bitter old lady in a wrinkled charcoal suit with purple piping.

It may not be totally accurate but Michael Wolf's portrayal of POTUS and the staff orbiting him feels very true when compared to the stream of consciousness tweets that make for headline news everyday. Very entertaining!",January-5-2018,5
7263,"Reading this is like reading a transcript of a season of Aaron Sorkin's ""The West Wing,"" if that show had a mirror universe where the administration was completely corrupt and incompetent. And even worse, it's reality. This isn't a television drama, this is reality, and we're all stuck with it for now.Whether or not everything went down 100% like the author describes, if even half of what this book describes is true then I am fairly alarmed that this is the day-to-day life of the leaders of our country.While the book is not perfect, there are a few typographical errors and the narrative gets clunky at times, I'm giving it five stars for the First Amendment. You can't just censor things you don't like in this country, Mr President.",January-10-2018,5

7265,"Gossipy fun to read if a little tedious at times. Not very well edited for writing clarity and errors. Wolf quotes conversations that he was not present for which made me wonder about the accuracy of some of the specific details but it mostly rings true to anyone who has paid much attention to the  bizarre rants of Donald Trump. Most of the interest in this book, as the other reviews indicate, seems to be a result of Trump's own frantic self defense and threats as the other reviews indicate. Great literature it's not but probably worth the price if it helps get this nut out of the White House.",January-8-2018,3

Then, of course I had to read it.I didn't really learn anything I didn't already know about this train wreck of an administration. I found the book itself to be disjointed, and actually not quite as hard on Trump as I expected. It's definitely a Bannon vehicle, and I suspect if Bannon were still part of the administration, this would not have been published.I found it tedious in a lot of places and be was glad when it was over. You don't actually have to read the book; you'll piss Trump off enough just by buying it, but if you've not been following the news over the past year, then this will give you a good overview of the Trump White House.",January-8-2018,3

7273,"I am not a fan of Donald Trump so expected I would truly love this book, but it is so poorly written without a logical timeline it's wasn't even worth the effort to finish.  The author tried to cover about his inability to tell a coherent, interesting story by using $5.00 words when a .50 would do.",March-7-2018,1
7274,"This is a poorly sourced, hearsay laden book that would get ripped to shreds and given a C- if presented as a final project in any top 500 journalism graduate school in the country. However, I very much doubt the author intended it to adhere to The Rulebook of Journalistic Ethics and Integrity. In short, it revels in being a salacious story about gossip and innuendoâ€”fitting quite well in our age of social media, aggregated and questionable sources, and our own attention span lacking president. In effect, it reads like an extremely long, multi-part post in Redditâ€™s /r/bestof section.Regarding the â€œtruthinessâ€ù and authenticity of the facts that lies within: yeah, I generally believe most of it is probably true. There is not much secrecy in the bumbling ineptitude of the Trump administration and the in-fighting that is hidden in plain sight. Rake stepping seems a constant favorite past time of our Dear Leader and his cohorts. Bear in mind, â€˜Fire and Furyâ€™ seems clearly on the side of Bannon, so I would certainly take any of his character opinionsâ€”particularly, of those he clearly despises (Jarvanka)â€”with a boulder sized grain of salt. Also, there are some factual errors that are troubling to say the least. For example, Wolff suggests that Trumpâ€™s father was definitely a member of the KKK. From my cursory research on the topic, this claim seems circumstantial at best. There are also errors in poll numbers sprinkled throughout the text.Should you read it? Perhaps, but donâ€™t expect anything terribly enlightening. If youâ€™re like me: a mainstream liberal who reads the failing New York Times and the Bezos Washington Post, I doubt any of this will be much of a surprise to you. What the book mainly does is sum up the top 50 forehead slapping headlines of this disastrous presidency in the past year, so if youâ€™ve been paying attention, youâ€™ve already read a version of this. I suppose it is useful to have a story arc within a single book that covers the first year of the Trump presidency.

7298,"I am certainly no fan of President Trump, didn't vote for him, and he appears to me to be impulsive, narcissistic and childish.  I find the policies that he supports regarding the environment, tax reform, health care and international politics to either ignorant, short-sighted and/or self-serving.  However, in reading this book, I do get the impression that he has not receive a fair 'shake' from the media and feel that he is not being treated in the same way as past presidents.  Do I think that this is unfair?  Yes.  But, do I also resent that he is undoing many of the President Obama policies that I supported and believed in?  Yes.  Do I feel that his arrogance invites these types of negative reactions towards him and that he needs a fairly large dose of humility?  Yes.Most importantly though, I feel that this book provides an outstanding insider view into politics in President Trump's White House as well as politics in the White House of previous presidents.  My conclusion from all of this is that politics is dirty, the leaders in our government are not looking out for the welfare of regular individuals, and that no president, current or previous, is any better than another.  These presidents are simply the face of a very complex political machine in the background that is constantly looking to shift wealth into the hands of the few.My hats off to Mr. Wolff for writing a hugely entertaining book that was easy to read.",January-6-2018,5

Nothing in this book will surprise anyone who has been following the antics of Trump since well before he was elected.  It is a gossip column that goes on for 310 pages. He explains Bannonâ€™s strategies to dominate the president, including how he intended to use Executive Orders to fully carry out his malignant view of how things should be like America in 1955.  He clarifies the roles of Trumpâ€™s key family members - Ivanka and Jared are self-serving, brand building, naive, immoral children.  Don and Eric are dopey losers.  Melania is the trophy wife who wanted none of it and will fade far into the background before divorcing him at some point.  All the comings and goings of so many staff members are shown to be nothing more that the product of the President himself.  Ignorant, uninformed, mentally challenged, mentally deficient, immoral, profoundly evil, a malignant narcissist, irrational, grandiose, paranoid, aggressive, irritable, impulsive.  Whatever it is that Trump does not want us to know about his Russia connection will come out eventually and blow up his presidency.

Hard to determine the accuracy of what he writes, or whether he uses popular perceptions of this investor turned President, to spin a series of vignettes that awfulize Trump further. But if even a small amount of what he claims to be direct information from White House senior and support staff is true, then the nation and especially the credibility of the Republican Party are in grave danger.

Trump is stupid and so are all of his kids. There is no explanation given as to how he was able to become a successful billionaire business man and become elected President of the United States.

7346,"In today's modern climate of intense and angry political polarization, it's easy for the lines between gossip, spin and contemporary political history to get blurred. So is the story of a deeply disorganized and dysfunctional White House told by Vanity Fair contributor Michael Wolff, in Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House reality, misdirection from manipulative sources, or the product of a vengeful enemy of the current administration? It's not easy to discern where Wolff is coming from, but his description of the current West Wing, in the words of one of the book's subjects, ""makes Shakespeare look like Dr. Seuss"".Wolff tells the story or a Trump White House as divided as the nation itself. On the right there is Steve Bannon and the Breitbart faction. In the middle is Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, representing the GOP establishment, and on the left, the president's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jarred Kushner (dubbed ""Jarvanka"" by Bannon, a term adopted by Wolff.) Wolff describes the power struggle between the three factions, and the mercurial president who is at times dismissive and mocking of all sides. He describes the evolution of the disorganized organizational dynamics during the first year of Trump's presidency, including the controversial dismissal of FBI Director James Comey, the investigation into connections between the Trump campaign and Russians intent on assisting the campaign, and Trump's troubling agitation of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un.Wolff's portrayal of the Trump himself is a deeply troubling portrait of a megalomaniac intent on making sure that no one else gets too much attention or credit, who hates reading, who constantly mocks his staff in front and behind their backs, who chooses the wrong advisors and doesn't take their advice any how, and who has an unrealistic understanding of his constitutional authority.Wolff's epilogue is especially interesting, containing Bannon's predictions for the future of the Trump presidency (giving his odds for impeachment, resignation or survival), and the future of the alt-right in 2020.Should you read this book? That depends on where you are on the political spectrum. Trump haters will love this book. Trump supporters will see it as a political hatchet job. If you're looking for objective contemporary history, it's more likely that Wolff is closer to a Kitty Kelly than a Bob Woodward. We live in a time when it's becoming harder and harder to tell what's real and what's ""fake news"", but Wolff seems to have an impressive array of sources. The book is a product of its times. Those who relish this kind of thing will love it. Those who can do without hearing about Machiavellian political infighting should give it a miss.",February-11-2018,3

This presidency is a sick and dangerous joke on the American people. The sooner it is over the better!,January-6-2018,3
7351,"After an interesting start, I felt a bit like this was reading one of the NY tabloids.  Certainly, the picture painted of the work environment in the White House was distressing, even if well known from existing press sources.  I left the book wanting to know a bit more about Steve Bannon and his billionaire backers, the Mercer Family.  Immediately after reading Fire & Fury, I read Devil's Bargain by Josh Green.  Devil's Bargain, at least to me, if a far better book, at the very least in so far as providing sources.  If I reflect on the two books together, I am, of course, dismayed by the behavior of all concerned in the two stories.  One has to wonder about the future of our country if it is the case that the (relatively) unseen hand of a single, eccentric activist billionaire resulted in a such profound outcome.  Neither candidate struck me as suitable for the Office of the President, but living in NY, I could have voted for my dog and still, NY would have voted for the democrat.  I would love to see a quality, investigative deep dive done on the Mercers and their outsized influence on American politics.  To me, at least, that's the story we collectively need to be told.  F&F; is a worthy read, just don't make it the last book you read on the subject.",January-9-2018,3
7352,Ouch!,January-7-2018,5
7353,"I have been reading the New York Times every day since my landing in New York 58 years ago. Michael Wolff, in his book FIRE and FURY writes about some events and individuals that I have neither seen in the press nor on TV. I have no way to verify how accurate the author is in describing or revealing his information. On page 20, Wolff writes: â€œTrump had a twinkle in his eye, larceny in his soul.â€ù I wonder if it can be proven that Trump had indeed stolen personal property.  On page 78 he writes: â€œIvanka Trump, talking loudly on her cell phone: â€œThings are so messed up and I donâ€™t know how to fix itâ€_â€ù  On page 145, In the Trump White House, observed Henry Kissinger, â€œit is a war between the Jews and the non-Jewsâ€ù To me, this sounds to be a questionable quotation. I do know and appreciate that Wolf is at liberty to harshly criticize Donald Trump, the current President of the United States as well as past Presidents. It would be inconceivable in undemocratic countries. I am a Holocaust survivor. At the age of fifteen, the Nazis detained me in forced labor and concentration camps for three years, my school years. I had neither books nor newspapers. In Poland, under the German occupation nobody would dare to criticize Hitler, or his cohorts, in public or in private conversations; it would have intrinsically be considered to be subversive.FIRE AND FURY reflects domestic political vulnerabilities. I wish that this book will not exacerbate the discord in the U.S. political system.",March-1-2018,4
7354,"This book will play well with those who already dislike or distrust President Donald Trump.  Those who support him, or at least, are willing to consider him to have good intentions, will immediately suspect the authorâ€™s bias, which Wolff somewhat admits when he says he filled in some of the blanks himself along the way.Nevertheless, a few themes do come through:- Trump didnâ€™t intend to win, nor did he live a life planning toward the Presidency- This president leads by instinct- Those closest to the President wield the most power- The presidency is far more than one person- Trumpâ€™s family is not just his saving grace, they are part of who he is and who provides him balanceWith the right editor and co-author, this could have been an incredible book.  Historical context relative to past/similar presidents, and an appreciation for key military leaders (McMaster, Mattis, etc) would have added much-needed credibility.Overall, this book reads mostly like a loosely-organized compilation of gossip magazine vignettes about Trump and various members of his inner circle â€” with some great insight, but sandwiched by a whole lot of juicy, heavily-biased trash talk.  Itâ€™s worth a read, if only to see some inside baseball through an angry lens.One quote of a quote stood out to me as what should have been the central theme:â€œIt certainly is an odd circumstance if you live your life without regard for being elected and then get electedâ€”and quite an opportunity for your enemies.â€ù",January-5-2018,3

7365,"5540. Fire and Fury  Inside the Trump White House, by Michael Wolff  (read 6 Mar 2018) When I put my name in at the Library for this book I was number 22, but there was more than one copy and I soon had the book--though it was due in one week instead of the usual three.  The book has no footnotes, no source notes, and of course no bibliography.  I recognize that it is the type of book where some sources will not be wiling to be identified, but there are some things in the book which could have been and  I wish had been sourced.  It is a pretty startling book although I cannot say anything in the book surprised me since we have been listening to and watching the current  president for many months now.  The book tells much about Steve Bannon, apparently a source for much in the book..  On page 309 in the book it is stated: that Steve Bannon says he himself will run for president in 2020, and will be elected.  My first reaction was he could never be elected and then, with a shudder, I recalled that I thought the same thing in regard to Donald Trump in 2015.

7380,"A brutal and scathing account of the dysfunctional rot that is the Trump presidency.  That the author was allowed such unfettered access to White House intelligence is a source of wonder.  So there are 3 camps: Jarvanka (Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump) representing the progressive right wing, Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan representing the traditional GOP Republican ethos, and Steve Bannon the alt-right provocateur whose moment has come. The political intrigue and shenanigans from this unholy tripartite are enough to make MacBeth blush. I would wager that about half of the book is fake news or conjecture at best, as the author could not possibly verify some information, eg what the participants of a cosy dinner spoke about.  Also, sentence construction felt convoluted at times, which does not make for smooth reading. The book ended on a ominous note - that Trump is only the first agent in a movement to expose the weakness of the Democrats and Republicans and to advance the cause of the alt-right movement. Trumpism is more than just Trump, and ultra nationalism is the way forward for the US. Steve Bannon is featured extensively throughout the book as the cerebral force behind the Machiavellian manoeuvres in the West Wing. President Bannon for 2020? The world should be so afraid.",February-14-2018,4
7381,"First, this is a review of the audiobook.  I don't think that impacts my review, but in case it does, you should know that.Second, my review is not about the subject, Donald Trump.  I dislike (a mild word) nearly everything about him, everything he does, and every one of his hangers-on.  He makes me ashamed and embarrassed to be an American.However, whatever you think of our president (lower case ""p"" in his case), this is a horribly written book.  Wolff comes across as omniscient to the max; he knows the innermost thoughts of everyone in the White House, what makes them tick and what makes them ticked off.  It's a hard concept to express, but I've never encountered an author (other than someone who writes his own memoirs) as arrogant, but that is Wolff to perfection.  So, while I strongly suspect that everything he says is true, I hate the way he says it.That goes for his writing style as well as his content.  He loves lawyerly, complicated sentences with lots of appositive (?) clauses that he sets off with commas.  As someone who's practiced law for 40+ years and who's seen his unfair share of horrible legalistic writing, I can't say how off-putting this style is.  If Wolff thinks it makes him look erudite, he's wrong; it comes across (together with his tone) as pompous and inflated.The narrator of the book is bad as well; he uses very odd pronunciations in many cases (one phrase that sticks in myth mind is ""ne plus ultra""; I can't convey it in writing, but he mangles it).  He pronounces Lewandowski as ""Loovandowski"" (I've never heard anyone else treat the ""w"" in the name as if it were a ""v"".  And so on.Finally, if you haven't read (or listened to) the book by now, save your money.  All the good stuff is long since out there, as Wolff, who appears to be as big a media whore as his subject, appeared on every TV show known to mankind, full of the quotes that occupy the last part of the book.",February-17-2018,2

Plus, now when I read all the commentary or listen to the talking heads, I have already formed my own opinions.

It is entertainingly written, and only a few editorial errors and typos- perhaps due to haste of publication.This Reality Show is being aired to the globe by a huge cast of unlikely characters, and is bigger and  - no, I won't say better - than any other on media channels over the past many years so why not indulge? thinks I.

To plagiarize the book and others: ""You can't make this **** up"".  People have criticized Wolff's integrity as a journalist and I have no right to comment on what is not in my field, but he does make for an entertaining writer.

Staff who dared to question his dubious decisions, failed to meet his ever-changing demands or--worst of all--simply failed to stroke his ego, either quit in frustration or were fired, contributing to the constant turnover and continual chaos in the White House.Although Trump's first year is history and a new cast of characters populates the White House staff, nothing has really changed as Trump's administration continues to lurch from crisis to crisis as created by the ""flexible"" and often mindless whims of the president.

It confirms mostly what we all knew from the leaks, more importantly we are  left with our fury at Trump for attempting to shut down free speech. Cease and desist my arse, there is nothing libellous in this book. How could Trump look worse than he already does? Wait? A tweet? A comment? He went to fantastic college and he got bankrupted several times and won a race? If Trump doesn't want to appear stupid he should keep it zipped. We are left with a bigger fire in the White House to be put out. How on earth was Wolff allowed to frolic in the halls of the White House for so log? He could have been a Russian Spy. Mueller won't bother reading this, he is following the money.",January-6-2018,3

7415,"Fire and Fury isnâ€™t so much of a history book as it is a very long magazine piece. That isnâ€™t a criticism. Works like this that try to give us a narrative of important events in real-time cannot be carefully end-noted historical pieces like something Doris Kerns Goodwin would produce. Instead, Wolff gives us a personal view of things with the characters on display, and their motives explained. Context is key, and Wolff gives us a compelling story we can wrap our heads around.Some have pointed out the few factual errors, the fact that the book does, at time, have editing that could have been tighter, and that it isnâ€™t clear where Wolff is using direct quotes. This might prevent Fire and Fury from becoming a definitive work for this administration, but it gave us a contemporaneous view into the administration that no one else has been able to do thus far.",February-13-2018,5

Thatâ€™s all Trump, folks. If he doesnâ€™t like sounding like an idiot, he should send himself a cease-and-desist.Wolff has filled in the gaps with some humorous narrative about the stunned reactions of everyone who has come in contact with Trump post-election, but really, heâ€™s not telling those of us who have been paying attention anything we didnâ€™t already know. Trump is Americaâ€™s dumb, mouthy, petty, lying, racist, senile, handsy step-uncle, who should really be in an adult care facility, but through a hilarious and tragic twist of fate, is instead in charge of all of our military and nukes.But the book is still worth the money - for the laughs and the delicious backstabbing among Bannon, Kushner and Priebus, as well as for driving the final stake through the heart of the unholy Trump/Bannon alliance.",February-8-2018,5

I found his prose quite on point in regards to the shenanigans and, silliness currently taking place @ 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.  It was somewhat difficult to comprehend and follow, but I suppose that is par for the course (irony intended) in the Trump White House.  The continuous revolving door of personnel and wack job personalities.  I almost needed a flow chart.  Bannon is quite dangerous, as Wolff points out.

7423,"I went back and forth on reading and reviewing this book. I try to keep my reviews free of politics, and I typically like to think of my opinions as balanced. President Donald Trump usually incites the exact opposite. Most people are either staunchly supportive of him in everything he says and does or 100% against him. There's little middle ground. Still, there is no denying that Michael Wolff's account of the President's first 100 days in office has become part of the national conversation. As a person who writes a weekly review of books, how could I not read one of the most buzzed about books of the year?!The President has brushed off Wolff's book as little more than tabloid gossip. To be fair to Mr. Trump, Wolff does little to protect himself from these accusations. Wolff starts the book by stating that the version of events he presents is his best representation of the truth based upon the varying versions he heard in interviewing White House staff. The varying renditions of events can only add to the confusion of where the truth lies. Further, Wolff never provides direct quotes or references as is the norm in other works of non-fiction.Despite all of this, the most incriminating portions of the book are directly quoted from the President's campaign speeches, tweets, and press briefings. To the approval of his supporters and horror of his detractors, Donald Trump has never been one to mince words. He says exactly what is on his mind. That being said, reading the often incoherent ramblings of the President printed in black and white can be quite alarming. These irrefutable quotes seem to support Wolff's claims that Trump is ill informed about most of the big decisions he faces.Wolff also touches upon the alleged disfunction among the White House staff. He maintains that the President's background in business makes him more focused on the ""big picture"". Because of this, the smaller staff positions that make the larger machine that is the US Government fucnction have not been filled. Beyond that, there is a war for the President's attention and policy that was between three sections of American Politics. Steve Bannon represents the interests of the alt-right of the Republican Party, Reince Priebus lobbies for the interest of the traditional/establishment Republicans, and Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner vie for the more liberal interests. This collision of ideologies coupled with the President's lack of governing experience, Wolff conjectures, caused Trump to not achieve any significant legislative victories during the first part of his presidency.For as much media attention and hype that Fire and Furry has received, I was surprised at how little of the book was shocking or presented new information. Even the more inflammatory excerpts that made headlines are not so crazy. For example, one passage about Ivanka making fun of and describing the formation of her father's infamous hairstyle was actually a quote from years ago when she was a college student. History will ultimately be the judge of Donald Trump's time in office. Because much of Michael Wolff's more explosive claims are not verified by any specific source, I'm not sure that Fire and Furry will be remembered as part of that history. Rather, supporters of the President will likely not be swayed by Wolff's claims while detractors will use it to further fan the flames of their discontent.",February-24-2018,3
7424,"Author Michael Wolff, the man on the couch, who just kind of hung out in Trumpâ€™s corridor amidst the hyperbole of unfolding Trumpismsâ€”was an indiscrete observerâ€”left alone to record the shenanigans. Apparently he had received the blessings and approval of Trump and Bannonâ€”who apparently assumed he was benign, if not a friendâ€”a recorder, who, would document the happenings and put Trump and the workings of the oval office in the most favorable light in his upcoming book. The book, titled Fire and Fury, would be more like a tabloid expose than a whitewashed testimonial to an enlightened Trumpian governance.Wolff just blended in and has sort of made sense of the carnage. The end product does not glorify Trumpâ€”a bit unflatteringâ€”but it didnâ€™t exasperate the festering scandal. The book, although amusing, was far more innocent than I had expected. It was not a scathing indictment of the evils of Trumpism, but more a testament to frivolity and incompetence. If you are looking for salacious and unmitigated scandal, it does not quite register; what you get is a prism of opportunism and a kind of oracle of incompetence and chaos.In a tale of two books, David Cay Johnstonâ€™s Itâ€™s Even Worse than You Think and Wolffâ€™s own Fire and Fury, we have two visions of Donald Trump. In Johnstonâ€™s book, Trump is a dangerous, psychopathic, aspiring dictator, while Wolfâ€™s Trump is more like a â€œplay thingâ€ù or amusement. The tone of Johnstonâ€™s book is seriousâ€™ Wolffâ€™s is humorous, if not frivolous. The events begin unfolding immediately after inauguration. America has just elected and placed in office a man unsuited for the Presidency â€“ an eccentric, billionaire-businessman who doesnâ€™t read books and has an attention span of about five seconds, or less. Trump seems to have set out to reconstruct the White House into an arrangement similar to his own Trumpian business-organizational model. Fire and Fury unfurls with a conversation between Roger Ailes and Steve Bannonâ€”a performer with charisma who, some think, leads Trump around on a leash. Apparently there is some animosity between Ailes and the other Fox News honcho, Rupert Murdock, since Ailes was ousted by the Fox management team. The Ailes-Bannon conversation suggests that Murdock is a moderate compared to Ailes, and wants to steer Trump toward Establishment moderation. Murdock has forcefully lectured the President about the oddness and extremism of Bannonism, linking Bannon with Ailes. (Page 47) Trump seems to be siding with Murdock, to the dismay of both Ailes and Bannon.Trump, the first Fox News President, ran a â€œBannon campaignâ€ù about nationalism. Contrarily, Bannon is now predicting a great nationalist rise by Chinaâ€”like Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Bannon, as campaign strategist, had devised a brilliant campaign strategy that targeted white, working-class malcontents in select rustbelt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Bannon had acknowledged that a win was unlikely, but he wanted to win. But the real idea behind the Trump campaign was to build the Trump brandâ€”to enhance his celebrity status so that â€œThe Donaldâ€ù was sure to get his own conservative TV network. If by some remote chance Trump ended up winning, Bannon could certainly take credit and his brand would also rise. For Trump and his closest advisors, excluding Bannon, the goal was not to win the presidency. For Trump, losing was winning. But a revelation had eclipsed reality. Winning the presidency was a total fluke, if not a joke. But it showed with great clarity that the American working class, especially in the South and Midwestern rustbelt, were solidly behind Trump and the Republican brandâ€”the party of the uber-rich and endless tax cuts for billionaires. Democrats had lost this demographic. Hillary Clinton couldnâ€™t relate to them- at least not to working class whites. Those â€œschmucksâ€ù took Trump seriously at his word. But Trump, in his own mind, by losing, expected to become the most famous man in the worldâ€”â€œa martyr to crooked Hillary Clinton.â€ù This might seem contrarian for a man who constantly casts aspersions at â€œlosers,â€ù but in this case, Trumpâ€™s personal brand would soar. As for his staff, careers and egos were at stake. Merely losing was good for them too: Jared, Don Jr., Ivanka, Kellyanne, Reince Priebus, and Melania. Trump, to some, was kind of like a slick salesman who was being set up to win. He craved media attention, but also loathed unfriendly press. It was all about him.Trump, a man with an enormous ego that had to be constantly stroked and soothed, sometimes relapses into an unrefined, petulant case of grandiose narcism. He sought recognition and good press like his yearning stomach craved a juicy McDonaldâ€™s cheeseburger. His presidency revolves around his peculiar relationship with the mediaâ€”particularly whether they were friend or foe. Trumpâ€™s economic nationalist agenda is being steered by Bannon, who engages in broadside attacks on the media. The media is the enemy in opposition to every minutia of Trumpâ€™s agenda with a conspiracy-like fury. The legislative die was cast as a struggle between two Republican factions: the orthodox Republican Establishment versus the Tea Party-Bannon-Breitbart wing of the party.Bannon was the brilliant play maker, the strategist responsible for Trump's victory--the sultry king maker; but he was under the wings of his sponsors--the Mercers--who held the purse strings and his destiny in their hands. Breitbart was also under the control of the Mercers; Bannon, merely the co-dependent Breitbart operative.It was not just working class whites who believed in Trump. Southerners, evangelical Christians, rank and file Republicans, indeed, virtually the entire Republican Party, even Wall Streeters, were deemed true believers or, at the very least, just went along for the ride. The results of the election (winning), instead, brought horror. Trump had unexpectedly won. Now, Trump believed he deserved to occupy the White House. The Trumpian business organization would be consolidated within the White House operation. Business and politics combined. The Trump organizational chart fills in the political chain-of-command. Almost guaranteed to create chaos. Trump had to be gingerly coaxed, contained, and cultivated by his handlers. Bannon, however, is a power player who cannot be handled.The Trump Administration, as portrayed in the book, is a spectacleâ€”one to fear with revulsion or enjoy with novelty and amusement. Trump is a loose cannon, ready to go off script any second. Rife with humor, the rancid cast of characters looking for self-actualization are also loose cannons. The book gives appearances that Trump is somewhat delusionalâ€”like when he saw millions at his Inauguration but â€œfake mediaâ€ù only saw some 250,000. This begs the question: Is Trump a con man or a shrewd manipulator? Or does he suffer from some kind of reality distortion disorder? It is Bannon that has reinforced his tunnel vision and clarity. The book poignantly describes Bannon as an interesting and mystifying figure, if not shady: â€œBannon was not necessarily a nice guy. Several decades as a grasping entrepreneur without a satisfying success story doesnâ€™t smooth the hustle in hustler. One competitor in the conservative media business, while acknowledging his intelligence and the ambitiousness of his ideas, also noted, â€œHeâ€™s mean, dishonest, and incapable of caring about other people. His eyes dart around like heâ€™s always looking for a weapon with which to bludgeon or gouge you.â€ùThis ominously funny book, full of arcane accolades and sometimes chaotic, is about the daily workings inside the Trump White House (or Trump property) under the cultish personality of â€œThe Donald.â€ù Palace dynamics and colliding personalities must be reconciled. It is a description of a work environment centered on catering to the needs and whims of Donald J., of palace intrigue and overt and covert posturing for leverage and influence over the center of attentionâ€”the President. In the Trumpian Court, it seemed the Emperor had no clothes. Let Trump be Trump was a common saying. â€œRancor between competing factions persisted.A sundry cast of players looked to gain the edge and Trumpâ€™s earâ€”a power struggle among the factions for control of the White House. The Kushner side believed that Bannon or Bannonism had pushed the president into a harshness that undermined his natural salesmanâ€™s ability to charm and reach out. Bannon and his ilk had made him the monster he more and more seemed to be.â€ù As Karl Rove had been Bushâ€™s brain, Steve Bannon was Trumpâ€™s brain, at least until he fell out-of-favor. Bannon operated under a chaos management philosophy. A power struggle between Bannon and son-in-law Jared Kushner developed.Trump didnâ€™t really wish to share power; his is an unconventional Whitehouse. One professional staffer, Katie Walsh, saw chaos, rivalries, and the presidentâ€™s own lack of focus and concern and elected to resign. VP Pence was probably the most emasculated VP in history. It was difficult playing second fiddle to â€œThe Donald.â€ù Pence seemed more like a mere staffer, taking notes at meetingsâ€”useless in the daily effort to help restrain the president and stabilize the West Wing. The Trumpocracy was a national spectacle. All unfavorable news about Trump is fake news or even abject fakery. To help counter this torrent of vulgarian dishonesty, Trump sometimes resorts to hyperbole. Does this book capture the essence of the Trumpian Oval Office? You read and be the judge.",February-22-2018,4
7425,"This book was everywhere. Comedians were talking about it. Politicians were talking about it. Magazines and newspapers were talking about it. Trump was talking about it. Even the Grammys got in on it, with Hillary Clinton making a special cameo, during which she read excerpts from the book. It was supposed to be game-changing. Scandalous. Dishy. Controversial. It was making ~waves~. Hell, I even got unfriended by several people after posting status updates for this book! It was that #edgy.Naturally, everyone wanted a piece of that sweet, sweet edge.I'm a bit late to the game, since I got my copy from the library (curse you, waiting list), but I did eyeball some of my friends' status updates as they read the book, and their lack of ""OH MY GOD, NO WAY!"" was a tip-off that this book probably wasn't going to be the ##BIGSCANDAL it was being hyped up to be. Things rarely are. I think we all remember how disappointed we were when Rachel Maddow went on TV claiming to have a copy of Trump's tax returns that she was going to reveal, live, and it was just an old, already released copy from 2005. I was expecting that.FIRE AND FURY has two major problems: unprofessional writing and lack of cited sources. The former makes sense. The author/publisher apparently received a cease and desist notice regarding the book, and in a sweeping gesture intended to support the first amendment and the free press, they sped up publication, thus putting the book into the public's hands faster and thumbing their nose at the president (and also garnering a fair amount of publicity and demand, as well). But it means that the book is riddled with typos like this (although maybe not quite so unfortunate): Bannon was making his first official pubic [sic] appearance of the Trump presidency (130). The writing itself is a bit breathless and sensationalistic and kind of reminds me of GAME CHANGE, the book that detailed the campaign between Clinton, McCain, and Obama. Both books take an omniscient third-person narrator approach that makes the reader wonder, ""How many liberties are they taking with the story?""Which brings me to the second point. I'm a chronic Googler. I like looking things up. When reading nonfiction about a subject I find interesting or relevant, I immediately jump to the sources listed in the book, for further research. It's how I was raised: to question, to be skeptical, to gather data in the search for truth in the face of salient evidence. In the back of my edition of FIRE AND FURY, there is an index - but no page numbers, and also no bibliography or list of sources. The lack of footnotes concerned me, as many documentaries in book form have footnotes after quotes or data that are then indexed in the back by chapter with a list of the websites, articles, and interviews that the author gleaned that information from. This book did not have those things, which I found troubling.As far as the content goes, it told me nothing I couldn't have learned from watching Seth Meyers or Samantha Bee, or picking up a newspaper (God help me). If it did anything, it only reinforced the suspicions I already had: that Trump appears to be a childish, inexperienced, paranoid, petty, narcissistic man who needs to be fed praise constantly and obsesses over any negative statements about his glorious personage the same way Ebeneezer Scrooge greedily counted his coins; that Bannon appears to be a crude and nasty man who dreams of isolationism and wants to take down the liberal party with the same sort of elaborate schemes that Bond villains used to try to take over the world; that Jared and Ivanka appear to be trying to play Good Cop to Trump's Bad Cop in a pitiful effort to out-class the sinking ship that is the S.S. Alt-Right Party, but are in it for themselves as much as anyone else. It's freaking ridiculous, and not a day goes by when I wonder, ""How did we get here?""I'm as liberal as they come, and live in one of the most liberal places in the entire United States, but I will be the first to admit that this book had problems. And while I can appreciate the publisher wanting to support free speech and the free press, the move did appear a mite publicity-driven. I'm glad people are reading this book, and I hope that it will encourage them to ask questions, too, and maybe think extra hard about the people who are affected by such gross changes in government, but at the same time, I think that the typos and sloppy writing make it way too easy for the points that this book makes to be dismissed, and that feels like it's going to be a big mistake in the long run.But hey, that's just my two cents.3 out of 5 stars",February-11-2018,3

7429,"I purchased this book from Barnes and Noble to read. All opinions are my own. I do not even know how to begin to rate this book. Fire and Fury by Michael Wolff. Here is what I will say.......As an American, the highest office one can hold is the presidency. Our President has an abundance of responsibilities to assume and a bunch of roles to fulfill. As humans we tend to view all authority as bothersome. No one in the United States likes to be told what to do or how to do by someone or a group of someones, so no matter who is our President, I guarantee there is some person or group that will have issue with him. So with that being said nothing written in this book made me like or dislike our President more or less. Donald Trump is not, never has been a politician so I do not find it shocking that his first months in office were chaotic for him, his family, people around him or the fact he had no idea who should do what in what position. What does shock me is the behavior of people who thought it would be different. When you walked into that booth to vote for President you knew exactly what you should or should not expect from the candidate you chose to vote for, and whether you voted for him or against him, if you had done your research before voting you would not be shocked by what is written in this book. I am not aiming for a political argument on my page nor am I going to disclose my political opinions with anyone. I am just saying none of what is written here shocks me. None of it. Take words written for what they are, words. Do not put your own opinions or spins on things and read with an open mind and I do not feel you would be shocked either. _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸",February-13-2018,4

A bit like Stephen King's neighborly word-style.What to say about the content?Well, IF Wolff really did sit around the White House interviewing people willy-nilly as he says he did--as members of the Administration confirm he did--then it's even more important to read the book.

A play by play accounting is shared on the inside chaos that continues under Trump's regime and the shameful and clueless shenanigans that continue to go on - a good who's who in the zoo starring a plethora of unsavory characters.Wolff takes us through a sea of often clueless disarray and shares some intimate details about the president. Wolff shares that even Trump didn't think he'd win but had his defeat speech ready, he was prepared to say the election was rigged, how the Whitehouse struggles to function properly, and the many lies that the administration struggles to keep up with and cover up. This book is a frightening look into what has become of American government with said president.This is not a book that will make anyone feel better, but may give you a better understanding about how this presidency came to be.

7434,"There has been no shortage of books about the Trump administration and the 45th presidentâ€™s peculiar relationship with his advisors already. What immediately made this one stand out and suggest extra credibility came from Trump himself when he attempted to have its publication stopped.There have been many fair criticisms of Fire and Fury. Itâ€™s very poorly written. The circuitous sentences often need to be reread before they make sense, and some still donâ€™t. It gives the feeling of having been written by speech recognition with little redrafting for readability.Far from being an anti-Trump hatchet job, the book is about as sympathetic to the man himself as any objective account could reasonably be expected to be. Ultimately, it makes it harder to dislike Trump. The picture it paints is of a manchild who only ever ran for president as a marketing and branding exercise. Then, when he accidentally won, he took a little time to convince himself he deserved it, but all he really wants is the prestige and respect of the office. This has led to a 3-way fight between spivs and opportunists from the Republican Party, the alt-right and his own family, to control and influence his perilously short attention span.As to claims about the bookâ€™s credibility, most of its assertions can be verified by reports already published. Those that canâ€™t are not enough to negate those that can. Even allowing for embellishments by the author â€“ and there are sections that are quite obviously embellished â€“ if even half of this is true, the Trump administration is pathologically amateurish. So much so that theyâ€™re probably less dangerous â€“ at least in isolation â€“ that many of us have feared.Having read Fire and Fury, I canâ€™t be as angry at Trump as I used to be, because it shows the president himself as being an irrelevant figurehead. The real question is whether the country is being run by the nationalists Bannonites or the Dunning-Kruger influence of Ivanka and Jared.

7442,"I borrowed this from the library and read it in my kindle app. I read about 71% and returned it because I was so angry and anxiety ridden I couldn't read anymore. It was not very well written and had so many 50 cent words, I had to constantly look up the definitions. That said, it seemed it was written in a bit of a hurry and tended to skip around. However, I will say that even if a fraction of this is true, and most of the content we already knew about, then this country is in huge trouble. Trump is an ignoramus at best and a moron at least. It's the blind leading the blind with Ivanka and Jared in control, even though they're not the brightest light bulbs in the chandelier. Trump, it seems, is basically illiterate and doesn't even read what he signs. He is clueless. His staff is a bunch of suck-ups and doesn't know right from left either. He rails with the wind and agrees with whatever is placed in front of him. He's a child who seems to have ADHD, perhaps dyslexia, no impulse control and can't form a simple sentence to get an idea across. This country is in deep trouble if he continues as POTUS.",February-19-2018,3
7443,"I believe much of what is written in this book, because it corresponds with the news filtering out from the White House.  Wolff paints a picture of three cliques that are helping in the Trump Presidency.  There is the Bannon faction, the Republican faction, and the Jarvenka faction (Jared and Ivanka).  The sketch of the first year is of these three factions fighting each other for the policies of their respective groups and leaking news of the other factions missteps.  During the course of the first year, the Bannon and Republican factions were decimated.  Steve Bannon and the Breitbart organization provided much of the ideology of the Trump Election Campaign and the early months of the presidency.  The Republican establishment also was reduced in the stepping down of Reince Preibus, Shaun Spicer, and Katie Walsh during the early summer of 2016.I believe most of the stories of the early months of the Trump Presidency.  I hope that as the presidency matures, a more durable administration will succeed to these positions of influence, and come up with a capable government.  This book is a unique insight into the first year of the Trump  Administration.",February-1-2018,4
7444,"In a way, I dreaded reading this book. Dreaded being cast into depression. Wolff, however, writes as a journalist, reporting what he has witnessed in a matter-of-fact style, which I appreciate.The events come as reminders, with no surprises concerning Trump's actions and attitudes. What gave me insight were the aims of those surrounding him. Bannon, Kushner and Ivanka, and so many others are new-comers to politics, and their inexperience shows amid the in-fighting and chaos that reigns as they try to influence Trump. Bannon encourages the worst in him while Kushner and Ivanka try to make him appear more presidential. The Republicans try to maneuver him. The president, however, is like a recalcitrant two-year-old, given to temper tantrums and an unwillingness to listen to experts and to learn. Kelly is no more successful in bringing order to chaos than any of the others. And so we cripple through year one of the Trump administration.Here is a worthy read, interesting, illuminating, and important.",February-27-2018,5
7445,"This book very much reminds me of Ed Klein's books on Obama and Hillary. Both Michael Wolff and Ed Klein had very distinguished journalism careers and then found that gossipy books are how to really cash in. That said, this was an incredibly fun read. Team Trump--except for Steve Bannon--didn't think Trump would win. Trump was ready to launch a network from his fabulous publicity stunt. Then he wins. White House staffers fear him and talk about the 25th Amendment. Trump's weird reason for eating fast food and he never reads.  I give it 3 stars for being fun. If I thought it was reliable, I'd give it 5. Sort of like Klein's books with various ""sources."" Wolff and Klein seem to just reinforce beliefs their target audience wants to read. Giving people a basis to say, ""I knew it, and this proves it."" In the case of Klein, it's far right theories on Obama. For Wolff, it's just cobbling everything we suspect about Trump in one book. To be fair, Wolff had access to the Trump White House that Klein most certainly didn't to the Obama White House. Still, the bottom line to the writing are essentially the same.",February-17-2018,3

7450,"It's hard to believe it's only been 15 months. Michael Wolff's deep dive into the people behind the Trump presidency is likely to be the most gripping read of 2018. Here's hoping it becomes a standard reading in college PoliSci classes.Michael Wolff starts out all the way at the beginning, when Trump first announced he was running for President. From there, he gives us the backstory on Trump's personal and business life, as well as the lives of all the people Associated with the first 8 months of the Trump presidency. Bannon, Priebus, Jared, Ivanka, Conway, the Mooch, Ryan, their all in there. The book does little to discuss policy on merit, such as the plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it attempt to explain why Trump has done so many of the things he has done, like accuse Obama of wiretapping him. It's fun, and it's educational, making it a book I cannot recommend enough.",April-16-2018,5
7451,"There are reasonable criticisms to be made about Michael Wolff's inside account of the first six months of Donald Trump's presidency, and I'm hesitant to trust any particular anecdote within. In general terms, however, the book paints a credible picture of the chaos behind the headlines: a temperamental president who didn't expect -- and perhaps didn't want -- to win the election, a neophyte political staff in warring power centers, and a top-down focus on television broadcast news over traditional White House sources of intelligence and expertise. Overall it feels less gossipy than I had expected, and particularly insightful into Trump's governing psyche. This is unlikely to go down as the definitive version of the historical record, but if taken with a grain of salt, it's a surprisingly worthwhile read for anyone looking to better understand this administration.",March-18-2018,3

Wollf doesn't source anything - another reason for four stars - but he does get some explosive quotes, a few (most famously Steve Bannon) on the record. I doubt this book will be long remembered by history, because there will almost certainly be better written, better sourced, and more thorough retellings of the entirety of the Trump Administration someone in the not too distant future.

7470,"This book, at least initially, is one of the funniest things Iâ€™ve read in a long time. This is not to belittle the importance to the world of who sits in the Oval Office. But the author himself draws our attention to the similarity of the farrago that was the 2016 American election with the show and movie, The Producers. When Trump stood for the presidency, it seems as though it was simply a giant PR exercise; he and his team expected to lose but the Trump brand and everyone on the bandwagon would become even more famous and important. Therefore, it was win/win. And the actual win surprised them all.With few in the West Wing having any political experience whatsoever, the whole thing was chaos from the start. Very quickly, the people around Trump realised that his temperament and way of doing things would become an exercise in damage limitation. Two factions rapidly emerged: Bannon, Trumpâ€™s de facto Chief of Staff (in all but name), a shrewd operator who believed in Trumpism and completely â€˜gotâ€™ his bossâ€™s strengths and weaknesses. And daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, termed Jarvanka, who Bannon referred to as â€˜the kidsâ€™. It wasnâ€™t long before hostilities between the two camps reached boiling point.Michael Wolff is so adept at conveying the presidentâ€™s personality that one comes away from this book feeling that Bannon is not the only one who fully 'gets' The Donald. We see what makes Trump tick - and it's terrifying. With a swiftly changing line-up of personnel, it might have been easy for the reader to have become confused. But Wolff is supreme master of his well-researched material and he knows how to put the points across directly, with journalistic flair and a smart turn of phrase. On Trumpâ€™s reluctance to read, well, anything: â€œHe was postliterate â€“ total television.â€ù On Trumpâ€™s lack of appeal to the cosmopolitan elite: â€œHe was, after all, Donald Trump, however much you shined him up.â€ù Wolff is superb on the pithy explanation, here talking about Louise Mensch: â€œa former British politician who, now living in the United States, had become a kind of conspiracy-central of the Trump-Russia connection.â€ù On the short-lived Scaramucci who was, according to Wolff: â€œwired by events beyond his own circuitsâ€™ capacityâ€_â€ùFire and Fury may have been rushed through by its publisher; there are several typos in my (British) edition that let the author down, though I did allow myself a snigger when Bannon makes â€œhis first official pubic appearance of the Trump presidencyâ€ù. And talking of Bannon, whatever his politics and whatever we readers make of him, itâ€™s clear that nine times out of ten he was the cleverest one in the room. (I donâ€™t think weâ€™ve heard the last of him.) This is a really great book â€“ and as close as Iâ€™ve ever come to understanding chaos theory.",April-2-2018,5
7471,"Thereâ€™s no joy in reviewing a book that is remarkably well-written yet depicting a train wreck both tragic and ongoing. Wolff is a fine writer; his tell-all is crisp and organized. He scored journalistic coups and amazing interviews/confessions from all sorts of inside sources. Key to his access is the fact that there were three bitterly competing power centers in the Trump White House: Bannon, Kushner, and Priebus. Two are already gone, but while the trio was jostling for power in the early months, they leaked against each other with a vengeance. Forty years ago, it was startling to read Watergate details from Woodward and Bernstein, where they had almost verbatim conversations where only two principals were in the room. â€œThe Final Daysâ€ù boasted long, detailed back-and-forth dialogue between President Nixon and press secretary Ronald Ziegler. How did two reporters get such a scoop? Plainly, realizing that he was part of an unfolding historic saga, Ziegler agreed at some point to share what he had experienced. On the last night of Nixonâ€™s presidency, he and Kissinger were alone in the Oval Office. Nixon wanted Kissinger to join him in kneeling to pray. After blurting out a confession, Nixon fell over onto the carpet, sobbing: â€œWhat have I done? What have I done?â€ù Itâ€™s strange, almost surreal stuff, and it happened! How would two reporters from the hated Washington Post have that? Well, clearly, Kissinger bared his soul and told them. Itâ€™s the same here. Especially in the case of the now-departed Steve Bannon, this reporter ended up with endless on-the-record gossip and tell-all anecdotes. Two generalizations are especially disquieting. First is the moral cesspool of the administration. According to multiple reports, â€œTrump liked to say that one of the things that made life worth living was getting your friendsâ€™ wives into bed.â€ù He referred to fired Assistant Attorney General Sally Yates using the crudest of anatomical obscenities. The second is a well-reported worry. â€œTrump didnâ€™t read. He didnâ€™t really even skim. If it was print, it might as well not exist. Some believed that for all practical purposes, he was no more than semi-literate. . . . He was post-literate â€“ total television. But not only didnâ€™t he read, he didnâ€™t listen. He preferred to be the person talking.â€ù An outgoing email got leaked: â€œItâ€™s worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump wonâ€™t read anything â€“ not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers, nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored.â€ù I wouldnâ€™t take the now disgraced Bannonâ€™s testimony for anything in the world, but perhaps heâ€™s correct in his final diagnosis. He predicted a 33% chance President Trump would be impeached; 33% he would voluntarily resign or forced to step aside by the Cabinet invoking the 25th Amendment, and 33% he would stagger to the finish line of his first four-year term. In Bannonâ€™s estimation, there was almost zero chance of a second Trump term or even a try for one.",April-15-2018,5

7473,"I watched a video about this a few months ago. I was interested after learning that it was supposed to have a different release date. I figured that alone warranted a different release date. That and I also figured that would be a must read because, neither Donald Trump or his cabinet have done something resembling a good job.On that note, the author explained how his cabinet was assembled despite a lack of experience. In fact, Neil Gorusch was one of the few exceptions. However, I read nothing about how Betsy DeVos got her position just by donating millions of dollars.On the other hand, I thought there were aspects that could've been improved. For instance, I thought he could've elaborated on how Obama's image might've disadvantaged him. He stole from the DNC (an organization that's supposed to focus on helping Democrats get elected), and invited BLM to the White House, despite lacking the power to consider them a terrorist group. In addition, I also found silly terms used quite irritating because, this is supposed to be serious to the core.On the plus side, this helped me not feel sorry for James Comey for being fired because, he leaked Hillary Clinton's emails 11 before the election. I assume this prevented a landslide victory because, it worsened her image. In addition, I learned why he was fired. I found that somewhat eyeopening because, I always figured he was getting closer to the truth.All that said, it's explained in 300+ pages why Donald Trump has such an inefficient cabinet. This is also a big reason why you need to research candidates, rather than just relying on their promises and party affiliation. Speaking of that, I found out about a 'Democrat', who I'll call KH, reveal that she's still going to rely on corporate donors. That aside, I found to be a critical must read for the reasons listed, and because I suspect this is why Donald Trump lost some supporters. (They realized that his administration was corrupt from the beginning.)",April-22-2018,3

7475,"It took me a while to get my hands on this one - I was watching the scandal around its release, and laughed my butt off when the publisher scorned Trump's threats and published it early instead. My copy finally came in at the library, and I've been reading it off and on for the last couple of weeks. I normally read books far faster than that, and it's not a long book, but I kept having to set it aside for numerous reasons.It could have benefited from more thorough editing - between a couple of typos, some odd grammar, and a phrase being repeated twice in the same sentence (I think the sentence may have originally been broken across two pages, so no one realized, and then in the final formatting it was all together) - it definitely had some technical problems.It was also just infuriating. Especially the beginning, where so many of the campaign staffers don't think Trump SHOULD be president, but still campaign for him because it's impossible that he could win, so what does it matter if they don't think he should? That was incredibly frustrating to read.Honestly there wasn't a lot in this book that I didn't already know, but I've been following politics pretty closely since early 2016. If you haven't, and you're looking for a good way to get up to date on current American politics, this could be a pretty good place to start. (Don't stop at this book, though, there's a lot that it doesn't cover.)I can't say that anything really surprised me. Everything sounds like what I've come to expect from this administration. The book is decent, but anything terribly salacious from it has been pulled out and splashed across the news at this point, so if you've been paying attention, I don't actually think it's worth spending your time on. It's certainly not the groundbreaking INSIDE LOOK THAT NO ONE'S SEEN HURRY AND READ IT that it was advertised as.",March-22-2018,3
7476,"The book was made a success as soon as the White House and Trumpâ€™s lawyers tried to prevent its publication. But was it worth it? Is it worth all the interest it got for a couple of weeks, maybe a month?The journalism practiced in this book is first of all a lot too long. What could be said in twenty pages is diluted into one hundred? That makes some pages, many pages so boringly detailed with semantically repetitive elements that it could have been stripped down to one and only one expression.The second irritating element is that it is some kind of pseudo-fictionalized reporting based on a few facts, a few rumors and a few cogitations from the author but all in all little real serious factual objective reporting. Many of the elements put forward are hear-say and nothing but hear-say. It might be true the author was told this or that by someone who was a first tier or second tier witness of something. But it is unreceivable in court. It is hear-say.Then do we have to believe it? Of course not. But for some time these at times hardly believable pages become the latest gospel against Trump. But this gospel contains little. It is even less acceptable than the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus because Nicodemus was for most of the things he speaks of an attested witness or even actor of the events he reports. Michael Wolff is none of that.It is true it will satisfy the anti-Trump cohorts and it will thrill the pro-plotting-theory bigots since it will go their way. Trump is so limited at all levels that he must be the puppet of some manipulating Deus ex Machina that is of course not identified. So every version of the basic plotting theory that says everything that happens is the result of the decisions of a group of half a dozen obscure shadowy and shady people, will be nourished and nurtured with new allegations, hear-say assertions, and rumors.In one word this book should never have gotten the attention, care and promotion it got from the White House, except if Trump knows the basic fact that there is no bad critique or review, there is only high-sounding and noisy review or critique. This book is helping Trump occupy the front of the stage in the limelight for a few weeks and then he will have to find something else like tariffs on steel and aluminum. Make waves and it will leave an imprint in the sand of the beach all the bigger if your waves are really big.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",March-7-2018,3
7477,"I wasn't planning on reading this, because I didn't expect to read anything that I didn't already know or suspect. But then the other day I saw it sitting there are my local public library here in Cincinnati, and I simply couldn't resist.""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House"" (2018 publication; 321 pages) is like watching a train wreck: you simply cannot stop watching it as it's happening, and I simply could not put down this book once I started reading it. Much of what is in the book is, as I mentioned, already well known and covered in the media, but when you read it like this in one setting, it just makes you shake your head in utter disbelief at it all. Trump simply cannot help himself, which of course isn't an excuse for any of it. The misleading and the lying, the bullying, the megalomania, and most of all, the utter incompetence, in levels never seen before and never thought possible. I mean, compared to the Trump White House, the Key Stone Cops looks like top-notch professionals. Steve Bannon must rue the day that he decided to let author Michael Wolff more or less take up residency in the West Wing. Wolff has of course been attacked by Trump and others for this book, but it is undeniable that the overall tone of the book reflects more or less what is taking place in the White House. This book reminds me in tone very much of last year's ""Shattered"" bu Jonathan Allen and Arnie Parnes about Hillary Clinton's doomed presidential campaign, just riveting from start to finish.I have always been of the opinion that people get the politicians they deserve. And that is true for Trump as well. There is a segment in today's society that seems to hanker back to what this country was 50 years ago or so. Guess what: it cannot and will not happen! Time to move on. Trump is not the cause, but simply the symptom. For me the bigger test will come in 2020, when this country has the choice to continue the buffoonery that rules this White House, or decide that enough is enough, and go in a different direction, Meanwhile, regardless of your politics, ""Fire and Fury"" makes for riveting reading, and is a WINNER.",March-22-2018,4
7478,"Appalling, but perversely fascinating.  Since the 'highest office in the land' has been turned into a joke, I guess one might as well get a little entertainment from it.  From what this book describes, you might actually make a case that the presidency is unnecessary, since currently there's nobody home there -- or rather, as one White House staffer puts it, there's ""an idiot surrounded by clowns"" -- and the government and the nation still kind of continue to function, sort of.",March-3-2018,5
7479,"I admit to be being disappointed with â€œFire and Furyâ€ù.  Perhaps the book has been over-hyped.  Perhaps too much had already been revealed in the press prior to my reading the book.  Either way, I came away feeling somewhat deflated.Despite my disappointment, it was still fun to read the book.  Michael Wolff has an easy to read style and, indisputably, had extraordinary access to the White House, especially Steve Bannon.  Accordingly, we learn (or at least have our understanding confirmed) that Washington is being chaotically led.  The Trump White House is wracked by competing factions and there is no clear decision making or analytical process in place.  Trump is not making America great again; rather, he is diminishing the great republic.With â€œFire and Furyâ€ù, there is also a sense that the book has been rushed out to meet the publicâ€™s pressing demand.  This is probably true.  It means that the book is more a contemporaneous narrative of events rather than a considered analysis.  In due course, I hope that Wolff will publish and updated edition or sequel.At this stage, it is not clear how the whole Trump experiment will pan out.  Things can and do change very quickly.  However, it is difficult to see Trump covering himself with glory.  The man is too abrupt and self-focussed.  And, of course, there is Mueller lurking in the shadows. Yes, we live in interesting times.  Unfortunately, this old Chinese adage is meant as a curse rather than a blessing.",March-18-2018,4

7481,"I decided to read this book because the author claimed that it would end the Donald Trump's presidency. I doubted this claim because to me it seems that Trump does things that should end his presidency on a weekly basis. Nevertheless, I decided to give the book a try. I thought that if nothing else it is entertaining to read about what a sorry excuse for a president â€œThe Donaldâ€ù is. This book solidified my picture of Trump and his associates, however, I did not feel that this book gave me anything new. Neither was the book particularly entertaining. I was even taken aback by the author's tendency to sometimes treat rumors as facts - making him look like the man he is trying to take down.I think this book could potentially be good to read for people who believe that Trump is a serious and intelligent politician who is just acting like a giant baby. This book will illustrate - through lots of dialogue and descriptions of interactions between Trump, Bannon etc - that the current US president is not at all presidential.Then again, I don't think people who have not already reached this conclusion will be swayed by this book. It is simply more of what you see on the news on a daily basis. Personally, I would not be surprised if Trump turned out to be a serial killer or a closet homosexual. If it was any other leader I would be shocked by the ignorant and childish behavior described in this book. But in this case, I merely think â€˜whatâ€™s new?â€™.All in all, this book wasn't bad, but I find it hard to come up with a single reason for why anyone would want to buy it...",April-2-2018,2

7483,"Although Iâ€™m glad I read Michael Wolffâ€™s FIRE AND FURY,  I certainly  struggled to get though the book.  Some of his sentences were so convoluted and sprawling that I had to reread them a couple of times to find the subject and verb. No one should ever have to reread anything written about the first year of the Trump White House.  One time is surely enough. Mr. Wolff is very fond of sentences with dashes inside parentheses; but he sometimes uses them to his detriment. Here is a good example:  He starts  a long sentence with â€˜Jaredâ€™ as the subject, then gives the reader his long parenthetical filigree  and then follows up with â€œthat.â€ù Canâ€™t do that, Mr. Wolff. Thatâ€™s Grammar 101. And it is often difficult to know what pronoun goes with what noun.  In a word: a readerâ€™s nightmare.Wolff though is describing a nightmare. The early reviewers of course cherry-picked all the dynamite quotes.  While some of the dirt I found new may be old news to others, here are some of my favorite cherries:  Corey Lewandowski called Jared Kushner â€œthe butler.â€ù Trump could foresee his son-in-law as secretary of state. And Jared, an Orthodox Jew,  is also an Internet Unitarian minister and then can perform wedding ceremonies. (To borrow a line from Sean Spicer, I canâ€™t make this S up.)  Ivanka can see herself as the first female president.  Pence is the â€œweakest vice president in decadesâ€ù and â€œan empty suit.â€ù Kellyanne Conway is a â€œcry-baby.â€ù  Flynn is a â€œdrama queen.â€ù  Wolff sees Bannon as a  character for Richard Ford, John Updike or Harry Crews. (Someone will certainly have to explain that allusion to Trump.) And here is one of my favorites of many other things the author has to say about Bannon who always sees himself as the smartest guy in the room: â€œâ€™I know no Russians, I donâ€™t know nothinâ€™. Iâ€™m not being a witness. Iâ€™m not hiring a lawyer. It is not going to be my aâ€” in front of a microphone on national TV answering questions.â€ù And I had not read anywhere that Trumpâ€™s brother Freddy was in Wolffâ€™s words â€œby many reports, gay.â€ùThere of course are no footnotes, bibliography or names of sources in Wolffâ€™s book. But authors (try Bob Woodward) never include their sources in these kinds of Washington tell-all books. There are also incidents where only two people are in a conversation. Are we to assume that one of the two talked to Wolff? A page-line (246) conversation between Jared and Bannon is one example of many. With all Wolffâ€™s faults as a writer, he certainly can turn phrases and use language as colorful as that of the White House satellites. He is fond of the S word, and I saw a â€œwackadoo moment,â€ù a nice choice of words. And finally here is a paragraph about Ivanka and her relation to her father that requires no comment from me. â€œFather and daughter got along almost peculiarly well. She was the real mini-Trump (a title that many people now seemed to aspire to). She accepted him. She was a helper not just in his business dealings but in his marital realignments. She facilitated entrances and exits. If you have a D-bag dad, and if everyone is open about it, then maybe it becomes fun and life a romantic comedyâ€”sort of.â€ùAs other reviewers have said, if only a fraction of Mr. Wolffâ€™s book is accurate, the clouds are very, very dark. I just wish he had written it better.",January-19-2018,4

Very annoying.Example ""This was a successor company to DEN, a dot-com burnout, whose principles -- including the former child star Brock Pierce who went on to be the founder of IGE -- were sued over allegations...."" (page 55).Who writes like that?  And more importantly, what editor lets writing like that get published?The book is laid out chronologically, but jumps back and forth to lay out the background of the main characters. Including main characters that were discussed on page 1. Which is somewhat disconcerting.  Very choppy.That aside, a fascinating read if you can make it past the distractions of the extremely poor writing.  This should have spent a few more months with the editor, but they obviously wanted to get it in people's hands before they were fighting the restraining order in court.",January-5-2018,3

The ""Game of Thrones"" type battle between Bannon, Priebus and Kushner for Trump's ear is believable and there is plenty of Bannon dirt in here. The rest just doesn't seem to be backed up with much. That being said, if you can get past any issues with Wolff's reputation and the numerous errors, it's not a bad book.

7497,"The writer is prone to long sentences with many clauses and commas so Iâ€™m finding this isnâ€™t a fast read. So far, Iâ€™m into the first weeks after the inauguration, and itâ€™s actually been a bit dry. Bannon sees himself as a savior and all controlling puppet master, Jared thinks heâ€™s going to be very influential and important, and Trump is incompetent. Probably most of the bombshells have been covered on cable news. Itâ€™s interesting for background, but Iâ€™m having to take it in small bites. It appears a lot of thoughts are being attributed to others via clairvoyance as I doubt they can all be substantiated. I am not a Trump fan at all and believe heâ€™s an embarrassment in the White House, but I wouldnâ€™t have purchased the book if Trump hadnâ€™t tried to block it.

7499,"So poorly written and incoherent that I'm surprised the White House had trouble disputing what it says. Wolff constantly concludes a paragraph with seemingly unrelated, garbled points. The opening chapter was engagingly fly on the wall at Roger Aisle's dinner though what you get is no more than sugar candy. The next two chapters are a running account of how the campaign got down to serious business but nothing seems authoritative or thought provoking. Opening premise is that everyone thought Trump was a joke. Think we knew that. Painful to read because Wolff floats along the surface of second hand narrative with no interest exploring his material. Mostly a blab; written for money and no real care for discovery. Reads like a first draft. Maybe I'm not accepting of the standard for political books but this is an effort to read.",January-15-2018,2

The book is easy to read and follows the events as already have been reported to the public in some form, but does it great job of putting it all together so that we can never forget it.  Even if only 5% of the events detailed in the book are true about our White House and the impostures that inhabiting it at this time, that is more than any American should ever accept. The existence and experience of ""Javanka"", ""Trumpianism"", ""Bannanism"" and a President of the United States of America who cannot read, process, deliberate, and do anything more than satisfy his own psychosis is now a part of our American experience, memorialized in this quick read for our future generations.  I'm not a big fan of Mr. Wolf, but even if his book is mostly fiction, Mr. Wolf hasn't written anything in his that we as Americans do not already believe is most probably accurate.

It's amusing to read about the West Wing feuds, but we really need to focus on whether we can avoid worldwide famine caused by climate change or a nuclear holocaust over northeast Asia. However, if this book contributes to ridding our country of the Trump presidency, Wolff deserves a great honor. May it come to pass!",February-3-2018,4

Well-written and factually-based.  I have found myself mentally referring back to it as I read and listen to what comes out of the White House, trying to figure out who in the WH is leaking - or who DJT spoke with on the phone the night before.  It was particularly interesting to read the Glenn Simpson hearing transcript contemporaneously with this book.  It's very clear that the things being discovered about this president and his family are true.

Considering the authors reputation while an interesting read it's abundantly apparent he is targeting a biased readership he assumed lack critical thinking skills and will buy unsourced gossip as gospel reporting.  Considering the abundance of books with cited sources? One must read this with some degree of objective criticism.

This disturbing book is a chronicling of most of the flaws and shenanigans of the current inept White House, and proof that we have lowered our standards bigtime.  Both the left and right should be concerned since DJT is not a traditional, stable Republican.  He is part of the alt-right reactionary fringe that is most capable of hurtling us towards a nuclear conflagration that could otherwise be prevented if a stable, competent POTUS and his staff were in power!  Even the 'doomsday clock' has been pushed up to '2 minutes to midnight', which is scary stuff indeed!  To further compound this scary predicament, Trump actually lost by 3 million votes, yet he has become the leader of the free world!

Nothing new if you've been following the disaster that is the Trump White House.It's very amusing and a bit nostalgic to read about the chaos that surrounded the administration during the first nine months.

It took me a little longer to read the book than it should have taken because the author had so many modifying phrases, sometimes separated by commas, and sometimes separated by dashes.  With so many words between the subject and the predicate, I found that often I needed to read sentences two or three times to understand what the author was saying.  The author used some political jargon with which I was not familiar so that slowed me down a bit.  I found at least 10 typos in the book and think those should have been corrected by the editor.  At times I had a news program on tv while reading this book, and I found it amazing that today's news was often very close to the contents of this book.

If you're not a political junkie, then you'll likely be satisfied simply reading the highlights which hti the news outlets the first week the book was out. Those highlights are enough and very few others remain otherwise. It's challenging to read a book in the middle of the administration the book is about and hear of officials who are no longer a part of the administration because so many have left since the book was written.

That is great for an author who is touting their book as fiction but not so great for a non-fiction writer. As a long time customer, probably one of Amazon's most loyal customers, I have to say that someone is tampering with reviews to encourage book sales or propaganda.  There is no way that intelligent, educated scholars and avid readers would review this book as 4 1/2 stars and I am inclined to believe that none of the books reviewed on amazon will have truthful, accurate reviews now.

To Wolff's credit, it's a central figure in his crusade to change modern politics by purging the White hour of rivals, particularly Jared & Ivanka Kushner. Wolff's bias is not as gratuitous as David Clay Johnson's awful ""The Making of Donald Trump"", yet the recollection of outrageous conversations are believable (anyone remember Oliver Stone's 2008 ""W.""? It's like that, but not as stupid). Much of the interplay rings similar to the detailed description of of presidential biographies, yet Wolff leans a tad too far to the left in his subtext to be taken wholly serious - nevertheless, a solid ""first draft"" of President's Trump's era.",April-21-2018,4

Time flew as I listened to tales of backstabbing and paranoia as everyone around Trump comes to the realization that they are on a sinking ship. We have definitely dodged a bullet by having such a thin skinned megalomaniac rise to power instead of a disciplined demagogue. Bannon, who clearly saw the characters in this tragic comedy for who they really were, was the closest he will ever come to power and this is a good thing. He had the darkest message but he was the brightest among the clowns who now reside at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I can not think of anyone more deserving of each other than Trump, his family and sycophants nor can I imagine the daily tremors vibrating through the halls of the White House as Mueller delves into these charlatan's finances.

I understand why he would not explicitly disclose his sources, but I think he should have at least vaguely hinted or even said something as simple as whether it came from his observations or somebody telling him, and if so, whether that source witnessed it first hand or was telling a second hand story. And how does he know what Trump is thinking in an exact moment? Is he inside Trump's brain? Did Trump tell him directly? Did he overhear something? This book just gives Conservatives more leverage in the whole Fake News debate because Wolff wrote this book in a way that makes his information sound, frankly, like fake news. The book was disorganized and poorly written, frankly.And why is there such a fuss over this? Trump is an incompetent troll and a misogynist-- What a surprise!!",February-6-2018,3
7548,"I had low expectations about this book, but found it very well written with detailed intrigue on the Machiavellian machinations inside the West Wing. I found myself looking up word definitions from the book. Absolutely riveting. Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, and Ivanka and Jared Kushner fight for power. Funny dialogue and Trump's oblivion about many world events paint a disturbing picture for the country.",April-29-2018,4
7549,350+ pages of he said-she said and not particularly well told. Difficult to maintain interest in each and every interpersonal dynamic. All and all a sad state of affairs that our country is being led by a poorly prepared group of people. Sad.,January-7-2018,3
7550,"Is it just me or is this a really poorly written book?""(Bannon) leveraged his gaming experience into using Gamergateâ€”a precursor alt-right movement that coalesced around an antipathy toward, and harassment of, women working in the online gaming industryâ€”to build vast amounts of traffic through the virality of political memes.""

7552,"Usually when I pick up an interesting book I'll digest it in a day.  This one took me almost a month as I just couldn't bond with this author. I just found that I was reliving what I just watched on the news last year with little in the way of new revelations.  In addition everything I ready suspected ""on the inside"" was true so that left me with the author alone as the sole personality here and I found the delivery a bit uninteresting.  I'm pretty sure this book will appeal to the ""never Trump"" reader who's looking to affirm their beliefs.  For the rest who don't live under a rock don't waste your time.",March-15-2018,2
7553,"It reads like a bad episode of ""Law and Order""...very repetitive and way beyond the pale when it comes to the nature of the internal conversations. Either the principals are clueless or Wolff really did morph into a fly on the wall. That aside its a page turner!",January-16-2018,2
7554,"Most of what was read in this book is pretty much common knowledge obtain and publicized during the campaign and the first year of Trumps presidency. The publicity leading up to the release is the primary reason this book sold as it did in my opinion. I feel as if the author, Michael Wolff, was more interested in putting his intelligence on display instead of writing about the Trump Whitehouse. The constant use of extravagant words or words not commonly used by the everyday reader was over the top. It felt to me like Wolff used a thesaurus to come up with words that the common man would have to use a dictionary to understand what he was attempting to say. I just didnâ€™t understand the use of words that are not used in everyday conversation other than Wolff trying to prove he was smarter than the common person. I guess what Iâ€™m trying to say is that I spent more time looking up definitions that I did actually reading the book thus making this an extremely hard and boring read. I would not recommend this book !",February-20-2018,1
7555,It was definitely over sold.,January-15-2018,2
7556,"I got this book and I am glad it was written, as the people need to know about the terrible things being committed by this sub-human monster.I would also like to say that I believe that Trump's ongoing criticisms of Amazon and Mr. Bezos are no doubt, based on pure, desperate jealousy and envy. Deep in his dark, mediocre heart, Trump knows that compared to Mr. Bezos, he is just little, insignificant (money) change. However, unfortunately Trump is in a potentially advantageous position, where he can try to hurt those he dislikes because he knows that they despise him. With Trump, it is about getting even with those who do not support him and his ill-gotten presidency.The bottom line is that that type of harassment on his part, amounts to a blatant, but serious abuse of presidential power.I just cannot wait for his impeachment!!!",March-31-2018,5
7557,"A compelling read and generally believable. I think Trump is the guy that Gary Cohn, Tillerson, et.al. described. Unbelievably ill-suited - and worse - to be president. But, Wolff needs to be read with some skepticism. In the end, he is probably 85% precisely accurate in general characterizations and even facts. So, the Trump crazies will jump on an overdrawn point, but the rest of us get the story.",February-6-2018,4

The reader does an excellent job.Even elements that one might say are likely either fabricated, or exaggerated, its all easily believed.So, take the book with a grain of salt, simultaneously knowing, the bulk of it is probably believable. Especially if you've been paying attention to whats happened/is happening.",February-2-2018,4
7561,"First of all my major peeve with the book is the timeline, which bounces back and forth - sometimes so quickly that it is hard to stay on track.  That said, the whole recounting(?), is truly terrifying, astonishing and disheartening. What kind of yahoo group lets a reporter sit in on strategic (ha) meetings without so much as an agreement??  It also shows what happens when real news and information gets hijacked by corporations for profit, dumbed down and piecemealed into sound bites for mass consumption.I listened to the audiobook, which I recommend, the narrator is great, and was truly entertained by the bulk of the story.",February-23-2018,4

Don't get me wrong, much of what he talks about is well documented by reliable sources like WaPo and NYT, so I'm not doubting the veracity of his ""facts,"" but a good storyteller could take the documented facts of this non-stop train wreck of a presidency and spun a good yarn, even including unattributed quotes.  It's as easy to interpret the motivation for this book as a way to make a quick buck as it is to believe he is giving us the straight dope of what's going on at Trump 1600.  The book begins to sound repetitious after a while, and most of the most interesting parts were released by people with advance copies before the book was released.  I wouldn't discourage a person from reading it, but my suggestion is to make use of your library card, not you credit card if you are curious.",February-22-2018,3

Yes, Wolff is not a historian but his inside witness to the conversations, feuds, and yes gossipthat flooded the White House staff and Cabinet was the best current snapshot of what was going on.  It was also notable how few people mentioned in his book have contradicted his comments.  Yes, I felt I was reading a rare first hand account of the turmoil.

I didn't find any of the revelations to be shocking or earth shattering. Politicians have to sell a part of their soul to be politicians.I'm happy that the Resident didn't block the book from being released. I don't think the people whose comments make up this book expected the mess they are making to actually end up in a book, since they thought they were going to lose anyway. I'm happy to say I did not buy this book. So I did not directly contribute to the money to be made from it. I say that because the conspiracy theorist in me won't allow me to believe the author got the unfettered access he had for nothing. I think a 'deal' was made for 'all access'. Still, in spite of the attacks on the author, there IS some truth to what is in this book. I will be generous and say if 1% of what is in the book is true, and more than 1% IS true, Lord help us.I was fortunate enough to borrow one of the first book copies that were available at my library. I have to say what others have said: reading this book is like you are watching a train wreck in slow motion --you can't stop looking. I found it mind numbing to read in many cases because of how much of a constitutional crisis our country is in. None of the revelations should surprise you given how much of the book has been talked about on TV and what is in the 24-hour media.No matter what your politics are, if you aren't uncomfortable in some way about this administration, you are wealthy, you don't care, or you aren't paying attention. There's nothing this administration is doing that doesn't hurt the average American, meaning those of us who aren't rich in some way.  I suggest you read the book and as you do ask yourself 'Are these people who I want to represent me?'  Then do your civic duty and vote for someone with a spine and a conscience.

7678,"If one reads this with an open mind rather than an ideological bias, you'll soon discover that the big winner here is Michael Wolff.  Not only did he publicly admit that he wasn't sure what was true and what was either false, conjecture, or opinion, he told us this was largely fiction with a not so well cloaked veil in the first 25 pages or so.  He said that the press had ALWAYS given accolades and positive treatment to a new president--the first time they did not was with Donald Trump.  Ha!  Many readers will remember how the press treated G.W. Bush from day one, actually before the election, and I'm old enough to remember the fire and fury the press gave Ronald Reagan. At the time, I had been working for Jimmy Carter traveling the region setting up campaign booths and forums, and I well remember how the vicious comments about Reagan somewhat softened the blow of us losing the second term. So, with some clouded honestly, right there he told us this book was not to be regarded as factual.And, for fiction, I actually enjoyed it. It's so removed from what has been known to us previously as the current White House reality that even a stalwart Trump fan should not be offended. Nor should a neverTrumper or solid Democrat think this book is going to make a particle of difference in the coming years and elections. It won't because it's narrative and mostly fiction--we don't know what could be true as there's no sourcing.As a non-fiction publisher, I admire Wolff's execution of a fast money publishing plan. He certainly knew his market, and that this market was less interested in facts, sourcing, and evidence of truth in statements, and far more interested in confirmation bias content. And, that's OK from an enterprise point of view, and that's partially why he gets three stars, even in the face of largely fictional and sometimes fraudulent content.One reviewer mentioned he uses $5 words when a $.05 word would suffice, and I'll agree that was annoying. Others have complained about editing, and that publication phase was apparently all but absent; the errors are glaring. His writing, although it does not flow well, nor is any chronology evident, is typical of a pulp fiction detective novel, which I do enjoy on occasion.I don't feel cheated from buying the book, as this isn't Wolff's first rodeo, and the writing is not atypical of his previous works. His ""insider secrets"" never are, and his conclusions are always subjective and always lacking sourcing. Still, he's fun to read and he's a pretty good story teller.Vegans need not apply--this is USDA red meat, Select grade.",January-8-2018,3

7689,"For those that don't know: The entire content of the book is actually old news, stories that only had a single, shaky source, and thus were not ran by larger media outlets. Wolfe consolidated these stories, and then set out to create a meager impression that he had a source in the white house who could confirm all these accounts, probably knowing he had a good enough lawyer to avoid getting his bluff called on the second source. More of a sneaky entrepreneurial move than authorship. All that being said, since these stories were at the bottom of my daily news feed, I hadn't read past the tagline of most of them, and Wolfe did a fairly good job of plucking these out and assembling them into a list.",April-12-2018,3

7706,Although I dislike all of the characters and love to hear them insulted and embarrassed there is a lot missing here. The author shares the Bannon/Trump/Kushner ideology of â€œsmartâ€ù self interest self aggrandizement so the real crime here remains uncovered. Itâ€™s not that they are following Nixonâ€™s path and itâ€™s not that they are doing it for money as opposed to doing bad to serve a higher good. The truth is they have no idea as to what a higher good is. The author never sees the vast emptiness of his subjects because he shares it.

You can take the following as a very mild exaggeration of what you can expect in the book:---> â€œTo the Bannanites it represented a de facture trÃ¨s classique BreitBartism, as distinct from the centre-left UNFCC Trumpisms, which the right curiously repudiated â€“ (something which Coen called a â€˜qausi laissez-faire abjurationâ€™); this was in stark contrast to the alt-lite which conservative liberalists like Conway, Lewandowsky, Miller and Hicks putatively supported. It was marked as a coup de grÃ¢ce to the JarVanka factions after they were reeling from Piescegate, with the Muller, Spicer and Miller fiascos yet to pass.--->â€œItâ€™s a smothered mate via en-passant,â€ù said a bemused Bannon. â€œWe donâ€™t want the de rigueur realpolitik of Yiannopoulos â€_..â€ù etc.If you enjoy reading that type of language, this is the book for you.Shakespeare foretold the instance of this book in Macbeth:---> â€œâ€_it is a tale told by anâ€_full of sound and furyâ€_signifying nothingâ€ùI listened to the book on Audible.

Loves the 'big' words no one has ever heard before, which 99.99 percent of readers won't understand, and which 99.99 percent of the remainder won't bother to look up.  I guess I have to wonder exactly why I should give any credibility at all to his narrative.  It is next to impossible to put any stock into it..I gave this a one-star rating because I couldn't figure out how to warn others to not waste their money on this crap without at least one.

Deal with Elephant?Look at you barking yourself hoarse, and he just strollsNonplussedAnd doesn't care one bit about your noise.''Ho ho!' Pug says,'That's just what I enjoy,Since I can be a real tough guyWithout a single blow or bruise.That way, the other dogs will say:'To bark at Elephant this PugMust be a real strong mug!'",January-21-2018,1

Not much, really.  The book suggests that Trump is childish and illiterate.  Of course, the last thing a reader would expect for a childish and illiterate President of the United States to be capable of doing is to collaborate with a writer on an â€œexposeâ€ù project primarily designed to nix the deadweight of Bannon.",January-6-2018,3

Tons of words. Blah, blah, blah. I stopped reading on the first page. I gave this book one star instead of zero because the color scheme on the cover was pretty good, with the red, white, and blue of the glorious American flag. The picture of our President is not flattering. There are plenty of pictures of Trump where he has a commanding presence, but this cover photo is not one of them.  The photograph of the author is more flattering than the photo of our Glorious Leader and I don't understand why anyone would do that. That is my main question about this ""book"". The author had unprecedented access to the White House, so why didn't he take any pictures? I'm only inclined to believe things if I see them with my own eyes.  Photographs count. The author could have at least done some drawings of what he saw. Until I see it with my own eyes, it is pretty much ""fake news"".  Words don't matter as much as pictures when you are trying to Make America Great Again.  If the book had more pictures, a more flattering photograph of our Leader with his natural commanding presence, and more realistic depiction of what actually happened in the White House instead of the ""fake news"" portrayed here, then the book would surely be a huge hit.",January-21-2018,1

Cover your bases. A non fiction book that starts off with this may have kinda of happened - a little bit -- sorta ought to have been a red flag.As an avid Vanity Fair admirer discovering that he had been published there was exciting.By the end of the torturous experience I reminded myself that he was only a contributor, on occasion.Fury, might have been, months ago, an interesting magazine feature - its appearance, now, between two covers is nothing other than exploitation.On my end, my biggest shocker was that it appears that Wolff believed that it would be a revelation to readers that the president is severely impaired and not fit for office.That certainly is not news for the majority of purchasers.Many of us had enjoyed ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and this certainly was not that.here is nurse Ratched when  the world really needs her?At times - often- it felt as if he was trying to reach a word count or something. It was often long winded and tiresome.It would behoove him to release a short snippet of the tapes he claims to have if he wants to continue his number one perch atop any bestseller list.I suppose I ought to take some responsibility here.  How Bannon being the primary source was not a red flag from the beginning is something I must own.Save your money-- turn on the nightly news (not Fox) and you will know as much , with much more sourcing than is present in these pages.

7954,"If you value your time, read the excerpts variously published. The book adds marginal value and fails on several fronts.First, the book isn't particularly well-written. The prose is inflated, laborious to read, not the tight disciplined accounts we are accustomed to from wordsmith journalists. More the writing of a tabloid writer trying too hard to appear otherwise.Second, on the content side, the book is essentially a psycho-babble that is sprinkled with salacious quotes, some over-interpreted and others clearly speculative. There are many instances where staffers and friends/advisers of Trump allude to him in unfavorable terms (""idiot,"" ""fool,"" etc.). If you've been in an organization, for a period of time, with underlyings and superiors, sometimes that's how others refer to you behind your back. Or, even in your company. It's not that uncommon. In many cases, this doesn't mean a whole lot beyond a temporary relief of feelings. The author makes too much of it. The book is organized around such quips.Sure, when it comes to the President of the United States, one would think that more caution and discipline would be in order. However, keep in mind that Trump has been a reality TV star for many years which breeds false familiarity. People feel they know him, they have a measure of the man, and are more prone to engage in discourse reserved for pals, colleagues, and overbearing bosses. And, certainly the oftentimes crass manner in which Trump expresses himself does not lend itself to an atmosphere of civility and decorum by those around him.The speculative component permeates as a narrative glue of the book. A mild example is the statement, ""for many years, he had humored Trump more than embraced him"" (referring to J. Kushner) which, obviously, no one outside Jared Kushner can truly know. I even don't know if I ""humored person XYZ more than embraced him"" without engaging in significant contemplation and reflection. Even then I might not. The book is replete with such speculative account.A second weakness on the content-side is the over-simplified superficial characterization of Trump as a person. There is a penchant for popular media, including journalists, to engage in a cartoonish characterization of Trump which should be left to political cartoonists and comedians. This book is no exception. We are inundated with personal deficiencies of Trump which have been evident, for all to see, from the moment he ran for office in the Republican primaries. Surely, the leaking of the Billy Bush tapes was horrifying (whether locker room talk or not) and would have sunk the candidacy of any other man/woman. How did Trump manage to get elected despite all that? His uniquely polarizing opponent, Hillary Clinton, had something to do with it. So did the concerns of the middle class that the establishment, Democrat or Republican, had not given sufficient voice to. But surely Trump, beyond the superficial characterization espoused in the book, had something to do with it as well.Distilling the information provided by the author, there is little insight. The author doesn't seem to know Trump. Nor have those who have been part of Trump's inner circle for many years confided in the author. All that the author has going are quips, anecdotes, and second hand accounts, from which he weaves a story consistent with the dysfunction and chaos we have been coming from The White House. Oh yeah, and the book's not particularly well-written.",January-7-2018,2

But acknowledging a plethora of characters, and most you probably could care less about, described in detail gets really boring. As far as a story goes, this jumps all over the place with no consistency of time line, place, or even continuity of thought.

In the real estate development arena, Trump could memorize a complex construction critical path much to the amazement of contractors yet according to the book, did not know what a spread sheet was. Surprise, surprise! He didnâ€™t even know his way around Washington. That made him an idiot. To make him look bad, mention that sometimes he would not even see his wife for two weeks.

8004,"I would not recommend the Kindle edition of this book because, according to previous articles by the author, it does not seem to contain all the material that is covered in the hard cover cover edition. You do not get many of the stories that have been covered in previews by the author. This edition is cheaper,but because it's published by Macmillan rather than Holt, it does not contain the entire story.",January-6-2018,1
8005,"This review covers both the Kindle and the Audible versions, as I purchased both of them.  The Kindle edition is one of the better formats, like the format for JB Bury history books, useful more on PC than Android, but tolerable on Android.The Audible is expertly read by Holter Graham.  I can't stand the Audible Player, which is totally dysfunctional. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD TO PC AS THE INSTRUCTIONS CLAIM, YOU CAN ONLY PLAY THE BOOK ONCE AND THEN IT WON'T STREAM AGAIN, YOU CANNOT PLAY IT IN CHROME, AND YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD IT USING THE AUDIBLE DOWNLOAD MANAGER.  When it first sets up it offers Windows Media Player, but after set up you can't get the Windows Media Player. SO YOU ESSENTIALLY GET ONE READ AND THAT'S IT.  Considering the one read is more expensive than the book, who would want to ever use Audible again?  REALLY BAD PROGRAMMING AT THE AUDIBLE SITE.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE.As usual, the 'help' helps not at all.  Total waste of money if you can't play the book but ONCE and cannot download it!HOWEVER you can hear it using the Audible App for Android.  The app doesn't number the chapters rightly: to get Chapter 17, you must select 19.  But you can plug in a line cable to feed to your computer stereo speakers, and hear it. Which, was why I wanted it for the PC.  So I docked a star for the horrid Audible PC software.Hope someone will instead put this GREAT audio narration into WhysperSync, so you can hear and read it on Kindle at the same time.  Seriously, the audio is, if you can only afford one version, the one to get.  When Graham gets into the long passages pretending to be Trump talking, he gives the words a liveliness which makes you see how vapid DT really is.  Text alone can't do that.  If you READ what DT says, your eyes glaze over from his insanity. But when you HEAR them through Graham, you realize the Ruling Class (movie with Peter O'Toole) era we've gotten into, and your comprehension increases.The book itself is both famiiar and shockingly new.  Familiar, cuz all that stuff we heard said, is fit together coherently.  Shockingly new, cuz Wolff specializes in WINDOWING the POVs of the folks in the White House, so you see through THEIR eyes, how it looked and felt.  That's not a perspective I've found in the other books on Trump, and it's important to get a LIVE version of what it's like to literally be, 'a fly on the wall'.Many journalists are trashing Wolff.  They are wrong to do so.  You'll see why as you HEAR the book read.As always, yell at me if you disagree.  Feel free to call me names, I yell at myself all day long.",January-6-2018,4

I am fairly well read for the average person; it's a good thing I have dictionary capabilities in my Nook e-reader otherwise I would be constantly looking up words in a hard bound dictionary.

Page 3:  Confection (not referring to candy),  symbiotic, and, missing word in sentence re Bannon getting the job of campaign manager; my point here is for $14.99 a word should have been caught during proofreading.  Page 4:  Odd sentence structure re should have all cabinet members for the next 7 days through their confirmation hearings & the word Neocons.

I, like many others grabbed this up simply because Trump wanted to stop publication. If the guy had kept his mouth shut about this book, I would have saved $15 bucks. Kind of makes one wonder if Trump and Wolf were secretly in cahoots to sell this crappy book. Unfortunately Wolf loads this book up with heavily biased views inserting his two cents on most issues brought up. Wolfe leads the reader into his version of events without considering that every story has two sides. The heavy bias makes this book a difficult read and I found my cynicism was triggered repeatadly. Because of this I admittedly didn't make it too far into this book. My BS meter was pegged before I made it to chapter two!My advice, don't buy this book because you want facts.

It is a nonstop diatribe of salacious semi-plausible garbage that plays well with the media's portrayal of Trump.  If you are looking for an objective look at the Trump campaign and White House, this isn't it.Having seen Mr. Wolff interviewed it is pretty much what you would expect.  He is apparently a sneaky little weasel who tried to ingratiate himself into Trump's circle of friends and supporters to come up with anything that he could use to make Trump look stupid, incompetent, immoral, untruthful, etc. (Trump does enough of that with Twitter without help.)  The bias and intent of the author is clearly the impetus for the interpretation and embellishment of what he claims to have observed and learned.

You can't read more than a few pages without getting the urge to drift off to sleep. It also hits me like a cross between a bad Judge Judy episode and Jerry Springer. Instead of revealing, the overall tone sounds like it was written by a pissed off 13 year old whose mad at his/her parents. Add to this the disclaimers and it's nothing but gossip. The main reason I bought it was because Trump was making such a big deal over it. But instead of an ""oh my gosh"" around every corner, it's more like ""yeah, right"". Wolff either didn't do good research (which he pretty much disclaims) or he flat-out made some of it up. No smoking guns here, just recycled trash and innuendo. Save your money.

Not true. He resigned frustrated by the Tea Party in 2015. When you write a book about the president, especially one who constantly disparages the press for being wrong, you better damn well be meticulous.

8057,"Michael Wolff pushes all the right buttons.  â€œWatergateâ€ù is even in the very first sentence of the book (authorâ€™s note).  The events described are based on â€œconversations that took place over a period of 18 months with the president, with most members of his senior staffâ€”some of whom talked to talked to me dozens of times.â€ù  ***dozens of times***  The book starts out explaining how Trump had no idea what he was doing during the campaign, and get this... he was a puppet of Roger Ailes, Breitbart, Fox News and Bannon.  (Are those not the right buttons to push) Trump never intended to win.  He ran in order to get broadcast cred so he could start his own cable network.  â€”â€” This is a novel with real names.  There are no footnotes and conversations held when Wolff was NOT present are amazingly detailed.  Conversations in which the chatting parties engaged, could not talk enough about how big a louse and scumbag Trump is.  This piece of fiction validates everything Trump-haters have already claimed, with loads of bonus dirt.  Heâ€™s delusional, phony, and is even a crook.  As the author claims, real estate is a good front for money laundering.  The extraordinarily outlandish claims continue, Trump was the leaker of Melaniaâ€™s nudes early in her career.  â€œ...a shoot that Melania had done early in her modeling career â€”- a leak that everybody other than Melania assumed could be traced back to Trump himself.â€ù  (No footnotes). Before they wedded, Melania asked Trump if thatâ€™s the way things are going to be, because she wouldnâ€™t be able to take it.  Trump told her to sue him and he subsequently set up lawyers for her to see.  The pages are full of this type soap opera material.  â€”- The locker room talk tapes are apparently supposed to give us the impression Trump reveals this sort of stuff all the time, and to a guy like Michael Wolff. â€”â€” Those who want to hate Trump will love it.  It really is a sign of the times.  Someone can make as many groundless and preposterous claims they want, and there is a large audience who will eat up every syllable.

I'm neither a never-Trumper nor am I a supporter, and was hoping to gain some insight through Wolff's supposedly exclusive access.  Instead, there is hardly anything in this book that we didn't already know.  I suppose there is some value in hashing it all together in one place, but not a lot.  In addition, it's very poorly written.  Wolff uses hip-hop slang words like ""dis"" and pens confusing sentences like:  ""She and Jared, or Jared, but by inference she too, were in effect the real chief of staff-or certainly as much a chief of staff as Priebus or Bannon, all of them reporting directly to the president.""

However, from a literary standpoint this book would already be on the bargain table but for the subject matter. Any author could have written the same book and had a best seller.

8072,"Ordered the book but, my feeling is it's already outdated. From the interviews of the author it's based on the start up in the WH when chaos was rampant and in fluctuation, Bannon being part of the problem.  Remember this is and was a new, non political family, being pushed in many directions and certainly not loved by the old guard in the politicial bubble.I've wasted my money on two best sellers about Trump which turned out to be comicaly outdated and totally erroneous by the time they were published and put out to the public.Two stars based on the interviews I have watched with Mr. Wolff and the reason I purchased the book anyway, it's obvious he was underhanded in his so called interviews, which weren't actually interviews, just collected angst from general conversation.  If I am wrong I plan on making updates, until then it's fair to gather opinions on both sides.",January-5-2018,2
8073,"I voted for Obama twice and Hillary so with that in mind I think it is important that we read this book with a few things in mind.  Obama himself said he could not believe how limited the powers of the Presidency are.  The real machine in washington are the lifers on capital hill and I don't just mean the elected officials.  I mean the people who are retained across administrations that do all the support work on capital hill for our senators and congress people as well as the whitehouse.  They have long-term cushy jobs and are ""not going anywhere"".  By and large these are the people that actually run the country.  Sooo, with this in mind, after reading this book I am disappointed that this well known author would build this work based almost entirely upon hearsay and third-person rhetoric.  It's like he is playing to the crowd.  Hey, let's write another book about lambasting this President.  I cannot in good conscience actually say that Hillary or Bernie are actually better people.  The facts are that the economy is up $5 TRILLION and that we have experienced job growth in the last 2 months than the prior 2 administrations. The fact is that under the Obama administration we nearly doubled the nation's debt and put us at the brink of financial collapse with the loss of the American dollar as being the global currency.  If you do not have an indepth understanding of how things are really done, this book is believable and is more rhetoric that continues to drive a false narrative that continues to fragment this once great country.  Hearsay, rhetoric and a disappointing effort by the author to make money in this political climate when what we really need are facts and accountability on both sides of the aisle.",January-8-2018,1
8074,"It would be an understatement to simply indicate that Trump demonstrates the characteristics of a short sighted, pompous ego driven narcissist; A conclusion easily reached by his daily Twitter rants combined by his apparent inability to intelligently string multiple words together and not sound like a 12 year old child.  I concede that he is far from presidential and further admit that he received my vote, not a vote of support but a vote against Hillary, basically the lesser of two evils.Michael Wolff's book adds little to my impression of the Trump organization but is an affront to my intelligence in his attempt to sell this rubbish as the result of investigative reporting.  Short of Mr. Wolff having a supernatural gift of clairvoyance and thought reading, it would be impossible for him to create a factual representation of Trump and staff as throughout the book he references the collective and inner thoughts of groups and individuals.  I suggest the reader highlight the terms "" everyone"", ""they"", ""in Trump's view"", etc.  Somehow Mr. Wolff is able to discern the unspoken thoughts of essentially every member of the Trump team, Trump's wife, daughter, son-in-law and acquaintances without them actually saying what is written in the book. The author liberally takes every opportunity to inform the reader what an individual or collective group of people are not saying but ""believe"", ""think"", ""in their view"", etc.While there may be much truth in the story that the White House is far from organized and the President has few redeeming attributes, this book falls short in meeting the standards of credibility based on well researched facts.  Mr. Trump's questionable character, demeanor and erratic behavior should give reason for concern for our nation. The impossible perspective and insight required for Mr. Wolff to present this as a factual account of the Trump organization is an insult to any one of average intelligence.",January-6-2018,1

8088,"how can u write a book about someone if you know nothing about them. this guy has no sources. he didnt talk to anyone close to trump. not the family, not the vice president, not even the white house staff, nobody. its completely a product of his imagination. i cant believe he even got a publisher. he mustve published it himself. but, he will undoubtedly make money on it. everyone wants to think the worst about trump. but whatever bad things they say, trump is the only president that has followed up on his campaign promises.",January-14-2018,1

8098,"Update:The Author gets 5 stars for getting the reaction he wanted by his readers. But, as you can see in the news today. This work is fiction. I will be getting a refund, and am dropping my stars to 1 as Steve Bannon has made a statement. Enjoy your book!""Bannon said in the statement to Axios that his comments about the Russia meeting were aimed at Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign manager at the time of the meeting, rather than Donald Trump Jr. Bannon is quoted in â€œFire and Furyâ€ù as saying that Special Counsel Robert Mueller will â€œcrack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.â€ù In the statement to Axios, Bannon calls the presidentâ€™s son â€œboth a patriot and a good man.â€ùThis book is Fiction and you are all falling for it. Suckers! =)From the author: ""Many of the accounts of what has happened in the Trump White House are in conflict with one another; many, in Trumpian fashion, are baldly untrue. Those conflicts, and that looseness with the truth, if not with reality itself, are an elemental thread of the book. Sometimes I have let the players offer their versions, in turn allowing the reader to judge them. In other instances, I have, through a consistency in accounts and through sources I have come to trust, settled on a version of events I believe to be true.""",January-6-2018,1
8099,"I really wanted to take one for the team and pick this thing apart but it was tedious gasbagging and I fell asleep at about 11%.If you were a reporter for Newsweek or WaPo or something, and you were reading a story whose premise was that itâ€™s author was granted unlimited access to the WH and had concluded > 200 interviews after January 20th, wouldnâ€™t you ask yourself how the author managed to place himself in a conversation between Bannon and dead Roger Ailes where he was able to observe every sip of water and sideways glance â€” prior to when Michael Wolff supposedly got access to these people after the inauguration?It isn't even good for toilet paper if you happen to have bought the Kindle edition.I am dreading picking this up and finishing it even worse than I'd dread an HIV/STD test after an unprotected all-nighter at a brothel.",January-6-2018,1
